The committee is a sounding board for ideas and concerns of all participants, students, parents, teachers, administration and supporters.\\nThe focus of this committee is to achieve our school goal of producing college bound students. Together, we will unite and form bonds that will allow us to make the best choices for our school family, allowing for us all to be an integral component of our schools success.\\n“Many inner city students have been given lots of new opportunities because of the help and guidance at Milwaukee College Prep School, and my girls are included in this lucky group. I am very proud of the accomplishments of my 2 daughters, one who is at Messmer High School and another who is in Ojai, CA attending the Thacher School on a full $40,000 per year scholarship. This unbelievable opportunity would never have been possible if my daughter had not attended Milwaukee College Prep. Both girls are successful because of the high expectations they have met in their classrooms.” ~Mrs. Gloria Moore\\nFor more information on the Parent Leadership Council, please contact the group at your campus:\\n36th Street Leadership Council\\n38th Street Leadership Council\\nLloyd Street Leadership Council\\nLola Rowe North Campus Leadership Council\\nAbout Us\\nEnrollment Process\\nCareers\\nSupport\\nParents\\nStaff Resources\\n36th Street\\n38th Street\\nLloyd Street\\nLola Rowe North\\nMilwaukee College Prep is committed to equal treatment for all individuals.\\n Milwaukee College Prep does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, gender, disability, age, religion, sexual orientation, or national or ethnic origin.\\n\\t\\t\\t©2018 Milwaukee College Prep School.

The process of locating, identifying, and evaluating children with disabilities is known as child find. Milwaukee College Prep sends out a Child Find notice to all parents each Fall and works with parents and teachers to identify any potential special needs students in the school. This notice informs parents of the records the school will develop and maintain as part of its child find activities. This notice also informs parents of their rights regarding any records developed.\\nThe school gathers personally identifiable information on any child who participates in child find activities. Parents, teachers, and other professionals provide information to the school related to the child’s academic performance, behavior, and health. This information is used to determine whether the child needs special education services. Personally identifiable information directly related to a child and maintained by the school is a pupil record. Pupil records include records maintained in any way including, but not limited to, computer storage media, video and audiotape, film, microfilm, and microfiche. Records maintained for personal use by a teacher and not available to others and records available only to persons involved in the psychological treatment of a child are not pupil records.\\nThe school maintains several classes of pupil records:\\n• ”Progress records” include grades, courses the child has taken, the child’s attendance record, immunization records, required lead screening records, and records of school extra-curricular activities. Progress records must be maintained for at least five years after the child ceases to be enrolled.\\n• ”Behavioral records” include such records as psychological tests, personality evaluations, records of conversations, written statements relating specifically to the pupil’s behavior, tests relating specifically to achievement or measurement of ability, physical health records other than immunization and lead screening records, law enforcement officers’ records, and other pupil records that are not “progress records.” Law enforcement officers’ records are maintained separately from other pupil records. Behavioral records may be maintained for no longer than one year after the child graduates or otherwise ceases to be enrolled, unless the parent specifies in writing that the records may be maintained for a longer period of time. The school informs parents when pupil records are no longer needed to provide special education. At the request of the child’s parents, the school destroys the information that is no longer needed.\\n• ”Directory data” includes the student’s name, address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, major field of study, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight and height of members of athletic teams, dates of attendance, photographs, degrees and awards received, and the name of the school most recently previously attended by the student.\\n• ”Pupil physical health records” include basic health information about a pupil, including the pupil’s immunization records, an emergency medical card, a log of first aid and medicine administered to the pupil, an athletic permit card, a record concerning the pupil’s ability to participate in an education program, any required lead screening records, the results of any routine screening test, such as for hearing, vision or scoliosis, and any follow-up to the test, and any other basic health information, as determined by the state superintendent. Any pupil record relating to a pupil’s physical health that is not a pupil physical health record is treated as a patient health care record under sections 146.81 to 146.84, Wisconsin Statutes. Any pupil record concerning HIV testing is treated as provided under section 252.15, Wisconsin Statutes.\\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and section 118.125, Wisconsin Statutes, afford parents and students over 18 years of age (“eligible students”) the following rights with respect to education records:\\n• The right to inspect and review the student’s education records within 45 days of receipt of the request. Parents or eligible students should submit to the school principal a written request that identifies the records(s) they wish to inspect. The principal will make arrangements for access and notify the parent or eligible student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. The school will comply with the request without unnecessary delay and before any meeting about an individualized education program, or any due process hearing, and in no case more than 45 days after the request has been made. If any record includes information on more than one child, the parents of those children have the right to inspect and review only the information about their child or to be informed of that specific information. Upon request, the school will give a parent or eligible student a copy of the progress records and a copy of the behavioral records. Upon request, the school will give the parent or eligible student a list of the types and locations of education records collected, maintained, or used by the school for special education. The school will respond to reasonable requests for explanations and interpretations of the records. A representative of the parent may inspect and review the records.\\n• The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the parent or eligible student believes is inaccurate or misleading. Parents or eligible students may ask Milwaukee College Prep to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They should write the school principal, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the district decides not to amend the record, the district will notify the parent or eligible student of the decision and the right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the parent or eligible student when notified of the right to a hearing.\\n• The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information in the student’s education records, except to the extent that federal and state law authorize disclosure without consent. The exceptions are stated in 34 CFR 99.31, Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act regulations; Sec. 9528, PL107−110, No Child Left Behind Act of 2001; and section 118.125(2)(a) to (m) and sub. (2m), Wisconsin Statutes. One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosures to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the school as an administrator, supervisor, instructor, or support staff member (including health or medical staff and law enforcement unit personnel); a person serving on the school board; a person or company with whom the school has contracted to perform a special task (such as an attorney, auditor, medical consultant, or therapist); or a parent or student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. Upon request, the school discloses education records without consent to officials of another school district in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. Also the school discloses “directory data” without consent, unless the parent notifies the district that it may not be released without prior parental consent.\\n• The right to file a complaint with the U. S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the District to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC 20202–4605.\\nRevised: 11/14/2012\\nAbout Us\\nEnrollment Process\\nCareers\\nSupport\\nParents\\nStaff Resources\\n36th Street\\n38th Street\\nLloyd Street\\nLola Rowe North\\nMilwaukee College Prep is committed to equal treatment for all individuals.\\n Milwaukee College Prep does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, gender, disability, age, religion, sexual orientation, or national or ethnic origin.\\n\\t\\t\\t©2018 Milwaukee College Prep School.

I will use this day to the fullest in my quest to know who I am, what I want, and where I am going. I believe in the relentless pursuit of excellence. Education and success are my birthright.\\nMy superior thoughts, discipline, dedication and desire are the tools I use to pave the road less traveled to college and beyond. I am determined to build a better tomorrow for me, my family, and my community.\\nI am the captain of my own ship. I am fully responsible for the choices I make. I always strive to be proactive. I will surround myself with people that lift me higher and will not empower others’ negativity. Names may hurt me, but I will not allow them to dictate my destiny. I will always keep my compass focused on my ‘mission possible’.\\nThere are no shortcuts in the pursuit of excellence. The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary. I am never in the land of the done, but always in the land of the doing. I never rest until my good is better and my better is best.\\nI walk on the shoulders of giants who have gone before me.

Also, I always thought teachers (at least the few I knew) were the coolest and smartest people in the world. I thought I’d love to be that one day!\\nHow have you grown professionally at MCP?\\nMCP’s team of the best and most qualified educators around helps me continue to become a better teacher.\\nWhat Challenges do you face as a teacher?\\nFirst of all, I must say that I wake up ready to embrace the challenges here at MCP, but my most difficult struggles come from the scholars who face day-to-day obstacles, but we can’t let those get in the way of providing a first class education.\\nWhat is your favorite MCP memory of this school year?\\nMy favorite memory thus far this year was the look on the faces of our entire MCP family and the community we serve during our “Flood the Hood With Dreams!” program.\\xa0 It’s a small reminder of the broader impact we have in our profession.\\nWhat have you learned from your students?\\nI have learned they’re way more technological savvy then I will ever be!\\nHow would you describe the MCP culture?\\nI believe the culture at MCP is what separates us from the rest. The restorative justice circles work wonders in creating a caring family.\\nWhat’s it like working with other MCP teachers and administrators?\\nI truly respect and admire my “team”. The collective effort it takes to do what we do is powerful.\\nWhat is happening in your classroom on a typical afternoon?\\nOn a typical afternoon in social studies, we are diving into the pages of history and exploring how people’s actions and decisions impact us today.\\nHow do you reach out to students who are struggling?\\nThey know that, not matter what else is going on, I will make time\\xa0for them\\xa0to talk to me about\\xa0any problems they’re facing academically or socially.\\nWhat advice would you give to new teachers?\\nBe prepared, be organized!\\nWhat is your favorite MCP Cheer and why?\\nBallin….it gets the biggest response.\\nWhat are your career goals in the next five/ten years?\\nMy career goal will always be educating our youth. I found my calling.\\nWhat is something your colleagues may not know about you?\\nThat’s a tough question, I’m pretty transparent, I would say they might not know that I teach during the weekends and am heavily involved in grassroots community organizing.\\nAnything else prospective MCP teachers should know?\\nThey should know they’re being presented with an opportunity of a lifetime and that these scholars will touch their lives forever.\\nMs. Maloney\\nPosition/Campus: Speech Pathologist, 38th Street\\nYears at MCP: 6, I was a founding member of the 38th St. campus.\\nBefore MCP: I worked in MPS at Highmount Community School for ten years.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI teach because...\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nRead My Interview!\\nHow have you grown professionally at MCP?\\nI love that I have grown professionally even after so many years of experience at different schools and organizations. New teacher training was really eye-opening. We were given time just to reflect on our personal teaching philosophy and mission. I’d never really been forced to reflect on that before. MCP provides so many tools for professional growth, everything from the Seven Habits and TRECK values to the way we organize staff meetings and construct lesson plans. There’s so much to learn, and this far into my career, I still feel like MCP stretches me a lot each and every day.\\nWhat is most challenging and rewarding about your time at MCP?\\nPersonally, I am most challenged by feeling that I am not meeting everyone’s needs. I hold that challenge in my heart with everything I do.\\xa0 I constantly ask myself, “Am I really adequately giving every scholar exactly what he or she needs every day?” On the flip side, the reward is undoubtedly witnessing those moments when the scholars’ faces light up with understanding. I love seeing when scholars graduate out of the program, because they are so proud of themselves. Every time my scholars are happy, I am happy.\\nWhat’s your favorite MCP memory from this school year?\\nWe have a little boy who started in our school late in the game, and he came with many challenges. At first, we weren’t sure if we could meet all his needs.\\xa0 But now, to see the growth he’s made in the classroom is tremendous. Probably my single favorite memory is seeing him sit on a box with wheels we made for him.\\xa0 It has become his personal bus that he rolls from this room to his classroom waving like a mayor in a parade.\\nWhat have you learned from your students?\\nWhat I take away at the end of the day is how tenacious and persistent, and joyful and open to learning our scholars are. They are amazing, persistent little people.\\nWhat’s it like working with other MCP teachers and administrators?\\nWe have a really positive culture in building, and that we have built strong relationships of support and love. Of course, there are days that we fall short of that, but everything we do comes from a very loving, supportive place. It helps to work in an environment where everyone feels supported, and I am so happy that I get to work in a place that values that.\\nHow do you reach out to scholars who are struggling?\\nThe most important thing for me is to meet the scholars where they are, and to try to figure out the one thing they need to make the next step, whether it is getting back to class, finishing an assignment, making an apology, or participating in an activity. The critical thing is just to find out what they need at that moment.\\nWhy should someone work at MCP?\\nI really do think that everybody should have a chance to work at MCP because it’s a place where you will be challenged every day. What’s more, at the end of the day, you will know that you have done hard work that will impact somebody’s life.\\xa0 That’s the goal of MCP, and that’s why we’re here.\\xa0 I show up every day, work hard, and make a difference—I truly believe that everybody should have that professional experience.\\nHow to Apply\\n1\\nGet to Know Us\\n2\\nApply\\n3\\nPhone Screen\\n4\\nCome Meet Us\\n5\\nSubmit or Host a Sample Lesson\\nJoin Our Team\\nWe are an equal opportunity employer.\\nAbout Us\\nEnrollment Process\\nCareers\\nSupport\\nParents\\nStaff Resources\\n36th Street\\n38th Street\\nLloyd Street\\nLola Rowe North\\nMilwaukee College Prep is committed to equal treatment for all individuals.\\n Milwaukee College Prep does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, gender, disability, age, religion, sexual orientation, or national or ethnic origin.\\n\\t\\t\\t©2018 Milwaukee College Prep School.

State reimbursement is about $8,000 per student.\\xa0 This structure provides a great degree of autonomy in terms of choosing curriculum, selecting staff and allocating budget in return for a high degree of accountability. The charter must be renewed every 5 years based on review of performance criteria.\\nChoice:\\xa0 Private schools (religious or non-sectarian) that receive public funding (vouchers) for low-income students.\\xa0 A voucher is worth about $6,400 per student.\\xa0 It provides a high degree of autonomy with limited accountability.\\nAlthough these organizational structures differ, we agree with Arne Duncan, former Secretary of Education, who said that, “a student who walks through the school door doesn’t think about whether the school is a private school, a charter school or a traditional public school.\\xa0 All the student thinks about is whether it is a good school.”\\xa0 \\nHow are students selected?\\nMilwaukee College Prep is a free, public charter school network with four campuses in the central city that every child in Milwaukee is eligible to attend.\\xa0 There is no pre-screening of applicants for academic and social performance, or special educational issues.\\nIf the number of applications exceeds the number of seats available, a random drawing will be held to fill the available seats.\\xa0 Siblings of currently enrolled students will be given preference.\\xa0 Each applicant will be assigned a number, and then the numbers will be drawn to determine placement order, beginning with K4.\\xa0 If an applicant with older siblings is drawn, the older siblings will be immediately placed in their respective grade(s) as room permits.\\xa0Those children who are not picked via lottery will be put on a waitlist in the order their names were pulled.\\nWhat is the demographic that you serve?\\nAs\\xa0the map below indicates, our scholars\\xa0represent virtually every zip code within the city of Milwaukee, pulling primarily from Milwaukee’s poorest zip codes indicated by the high density orange clusters. \\xa098% are African-American and 83% are economically-disadvantaged.\\nDoes MCP self-select families with committed parents? Are MCP’s results skewed by this, and your ability to expel students?\\nOur parents or guardians must return a very simple enrollment form to us prior to the lottery.\\xa0 So while there has to be some effort and commitment exhibited on the part of the prospective MCP parent or guardian, as with other traditional public schools no more than the completion of a simple form is required. Once enrolled, they are our scholars.\\xa0 We do not believe in expelling our scholars and go to extraordinary measures to keep them with us.\\xa0 In effect, these are the same children that populate schools around Milwaukee. We do not believe our results are skewed based on who we accept: rather, they are a result of an absolute commitment to, and belief in, every child who enrolls with us.\\nDo charter schools hurt the mainstream public schools?\\nWe believe that the families who have enrolled their children with us are looking for high-quality education options.\\xa0 Providing families with more good options raises the bar for all schools and all scholars.\\xa0 At the same time, we recognize that we can’t reach every child, which is why over the past two years, we have welcomed more than 2,000 educators and administrators, primarily from traditional public schools, through our doors to share best practices and provide mentorship.\\nIn addition, while we are not a traditional public school, the scholars from our campuses are chartered by Milwaukee Public Schools, and\\xa0are included in MPS’s rolls.\\xa0 MPS receives state funding for each of these MCP scholars and then provides us with roughly 80% of this funding. So MPS loses neither market share nor money.\\nSome people say, “there are a lot of bad charter schools”. \\xa0Is this true?\\nThere are some “bad” charter schools…and choice schools and private schools and public schools.\\xa0 We believe in great schools, which is what we intend for each of our campuses. That said, most of the “bad” school press is\\xa0not referring to charter schools. Christian D’Andrea, a MacIver Institute Education Policy Analyst found that “data from the 2012-2013 school year shows that Milwaukee’s independent charter schools (like MCP) were the city’s most effective schools when it came to important metrics like student growth and closing achievement gaps.” In addition, all charter schools operate on a contract with their authorizer (either MPS, UWM or the Common Council in Milwaukee). Charter school contracts must be renewed every 5 years and “bad” schools are typically not renewed.\\nDon’t charter schools receive the same funding as traditional public schools?\\xa0 Why do you need to raise funds?\\nWisconsin has one of the largest funding gaps between traditional public and public charter schools in the nation.\\xa0 The state and local funding accounts for roughly $13,000 per traditional public school student and just over $8,000 for every charter school student.\\xa0 In fact, last year was the first in six years that charter schools received any increase in funding.\\xa0 To make up just a portion of this gap, we must raise roughly $650 per scholar.\\xa0 And yet, as we grow, Milwaukee College Prep has demonstrated the ability to take advantage of economies of scale without compromising its mission.\\nEven with\\xa0skyrocketing benefit costs, increasing salaries by about 2% each year and investing heavily in technology and new curriculum, Milwaukee College Prep has continued to lower the total cost of educating each scholar as it has expanded. Despite growth, our Annual Fund has remained static at $1.25m the last two years.\\nCharter schools also receive no funding for facilities, which is why we have held two capital campaigns in the past 5 years. Thanks to the generosity of many, we reached our goals of $5 million to purchase the Northside YMCA, in which Lola Rowe North campus is situated, on the heels of a $9 million campaign to purchase and renovate our 38th Street and Lloyd Street Campuses two years ago.\\xa0 These capital contributions allow us to devote our annual operating dollars to attracting, supporting, rewarding and retaining the very best teachers possible.\\nWhat makes MCP teachers different?\\nOur teachers are absolutely mission-driven.\\xa0 For them, urban education is not just a job; it is a purpose.\\xa0 They have chosen to teach in a challenging environment because of their whole-hearted belief that every child can succeed.\\xa0 Over our 19 years, we have become a magnet for the very best master teachers who share this belief.\\xa0 MCP then provides them with an environment in which great teaching can thrive and we support and challenge them to be their best.\\nWhat makes the MCP culture different?\\nWhile academic rigor is indisputable, the love that our teachers and administrators have for these scholars is palpable.\\xa0 Our scholars know that they can accomplish great things because they have a team of people who believe in them and will provide them with the knowledge and character to flourish.\\xa0 That said, the expectations we have for each of them are high. We sweat the small stuff.\\xa0 Uniforms are worn with pride, scholars speak in complete sentences, there is no “opting out” of class participation, every child is welcomed at the threshold of every classroom they enter, and Life’s Work (homework) is completed and signed by parents daily.\\xa0 We sweat the small stuff so that nothing interferes with their learning.\\nHow many schools is Milwaukee College Prep planning to open?\\nOur strategic plan calls for 5 schools, at which point we will reevaluate the need and our ability to best meet that need without compromising our mission.\\nDo you plan to open a high school?\\nWe graduate 200 8th graders every year.\\xa0 While we have successfully placed our “seniors” in high performing high schools around the city, state and country, it is difficult to find that many seats in the limited number of high performing schools in our city, particularly free public high schools.\\xa0 We are hopeful that more public high schools, like Carmen North, will open in coming years.\\xa0 Yet, we have not closed the door to the idea.\\xa0 If we don’t see growth and more opportunity for our graduating scholars, we will consider opening a high school as our 5th campus.\\nDo you work collaboratively to effect change for all children?\\nIn order to ensure that more students walk through the threshold of their school confident that is a great school,\\xa0Milwaukee College Prep collaborates with Schools That Can Milwaukee, Teach for America, Center for Urban Teacher, and many others to improve educational outcomes for all children. Milwaukee College Prep is committed to sharing best practices with schools, no matter the organizational structure.\\xa0 To that end, we have hosted more than 2,000 educators and administrators from around Milwaukee, Wisconsin and the nation.\\xa0 We believe that our growth, together with a commitment to sharing best practices, is the best possible way for us to help change the paradigm in Milwaukee’s urban education landscape.\\nAbout Us\\nEnrollment Process\\nCareers\\nSupport\\nParents\\nStaff Resources\\n36th Street\\n38th Street\\nLloyd Street\\nLola Rowe North\\nMilwaukee College Prep is committed to equal treatment for all individuals.\\n Milwaukee College Prep does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, gender, disability, age, religion, sexual orientation, or national or ethnic origin.\\n\\t\\t\\t©2018 Milwaukee College Prep School.

That opportunity begins at\\xa0Milwaukee College Prep. Our scholars and alumni demonstrate that every single day.\\nMeet the Alumni\\nRayanna\\nI attended Milwaukee College Prep 36th Street and graduated from Alverno College.\\nRead About My Experience\\nDescribe a teacher that impacted your life\\nMr. Edward Richerson and Ms. Kanika Burks impacted my life the most, because they were invested in their students beyond academics. They truly worked to build strong relationships with all of us. Yes, they had high expectations for us academically as students, but they also genuinely cared about my classmates and me outside of the classroom. If we were struggling in a subject they would come before school started and stay after it ended to help tutor us. They found hidden talents of students and used our unique gifts to motivate or relate to us in the classroom as well. They went the extra mile to ensure we were successful.\\nHow were you supported academically at MCP?\\nThere was a lot of support for me academically when I was a student at MCP. I always felt my teachers and other support staff were very approachable. It was a very comfortable learning environment and I always felt I had strong peer support as well.\\nHow did MCP help prepare you for high school and college?\\nMCP definitely prepared me for high school and college! It laid a solid foundation for me academically and socially as I went on my journey into higher education. One of the greatest things you gain from MCP is learning what it means to be an overall good person.\\xa0It teaches you how to persevere and overcome obstacles you encounter. As an adult, I still carry with me poems and proverbs we learned at MCP. \\xa0Because of the things I learned, I have strived for greater opportunities in my life.\\nWhy should parents choose MCP for their children?\\nMilwaukee College Prep lays a foundation that teaches students to be the best version of themselves. They strive for academic excellence. They learn early on, in the DOE, we never rest until our good is better and our better is best, the number one competition in our education is our self. Parents should send their child because they learn morals and values that will set their child up to become an upstanding citizen. You see many schools that focus solely on academics, but there aren’t many teaching our children what it means to be honest, trustworthy, and a team player. MCP does that! My mother chose MCP for me and my siblings, and now I get to choose MCP for my daughter.\\nTeryal\\nI attended Milwaukee College Prep: Lloyd Street campus for four years, from 5th\\xa0grade up through 8th\\xa0grade. I am currently attending Martin Luther High School.\\nRead About My Experience\\nHow were you supported academically at MCP?\\nI was supported by the entire school staff in some way or another, but Ms. Williams challenged me when it came to reading and Ms. Felder always gave me that extra push when I felt like I couldn’t go on anymore. Reading wasn’t my strongest area because I was shy and we were required to read in front of the entire class. Ms. Williams helped me gain enough confidence to speak in front of my peers. She would often tell my mom “the more Teryal reads out loud the better her reading will become”. By the time I was in 8th\\xa0grade I was speaking at our assemblies in front of the entire school.\\nHow did MCP help prepare you for the high school and college?\\nMCP has given me many tools to help me prepare for high school. It has taught me how to handle trials and obstacles that come my way. This will help me down the road in high school when I am faced with challenging situations. MCP has helped me prepare academically for the journey I am on, and I know that the sky is the limit. I can achieve anything I set my mind to.\\nWhy should parents choose MCP for their children?\\nMilwaukee College Prep is an amazing school. MCP is a family oriented school and they really care about the needs of every student. The class sizes are very small and you have direct access to the teachers at all times. Milwaukee college prep does a really good job keeping the parents involved and connected to everything the school has to offer. The support system at MCP is great, the alumni directors stay follow you all the way through college. The staff are still there checking to make sure you are doing ok, and find ways to help with a smooth transition to high school and college. I am sure you can’t get that everywhere. Milwaukee College isn’t just your family while attending MCP, they are your family for life.\\nJoshua\\nI attended Milwaukee College Prep\\nRead About My Experience\\nDescribe a teacher that impacted your life?\\nEvery one of my teachers passed on incredible knowledge to me and positively impacted my life in many ways. Specifically, the teachers who stood by me and gave me advice in trials were Ms. Davis, Middle School Dean of Academics, and Mr. Collins, Math teacher. Both teachers put their energy and efforts into developing my God-given gifts and talents. Ms. Davis is kind, understanding, strong, a problem solver, and is very talented. Mr. Collins is energetic, creative, smart, wise and an incredibly deep-thinker.\\nHow were you supported at MCP?\\nAt MCP I was supported in many ways. I received constructive criticism when I needed it and was uplifted during times of difficulty. I appreciated the teachers’ patience with me, and how hard they worked to ensure my classroom success.\\nHow were you challenged as a scholar?\\nAs an MCP scholar, I was challenged to set an example for others.\\xa0 That role as a leader encouraged me to be on point, maintain good grades and display excellent character, while juggling multiple activities and sports.\\nHow did MCP prepare you for high school?\\nI don’t know how to honestly answer that question. School has not started yet to make a fair assessment. What I can say, is that I am confident that I will do well at University School of Milwaukee because of the wisdom from teachers I’ve gained, and the many academically rich classroom/field experiences I had at MCP.\\nWhat is your favorite MCP cheer?\\nIn all honesty, my favorite cheer is ‘The Trucker.’ “Honk Honk, Good Job Little Buddy!” I just like saying that one for some reason!\\xa0It is a fun way of encouraging young scholars when they perform well!\\nWhat is one of your fondest memories of MCP?\\nOne of my best memories at MCP was my last flag football championship. All of my allies and closest friends were at my side competing for the glorious title…and finally, the last battle was on, and we had a most exciting victory!\\nDjdade\\nI attended Milwaukee College Prep: 36th Street campus for six years, from 3rd grade up through 8th grade.\\xa0 I graduated from University School in 2014, and am currently studying engineering at Marquette University.\\nRead About My Experience\\nDescribe a teacher that impacted your life\\nDefinitely Mr. Allen!\\xa0 He has a passion for teaching and is somebody who really wants to help students whether it be purely academically or more emotionally.\\xa0 He supplied a good, positive role model for us—and he always did it with style. He always set a good example, and his stories are amazing.\\nHow were you supported academically at MCP?\\nWhen I was younger, I struggled with reading, even though I took a lot of accelerated courses that encouraged independent work. Ms. Salinsky, my homeroom teacher, always encouraged me to read in front of the class, and kept me focused on the reading aspect of all my work. Reading out loud really helped me, and made me comfortable talking in front of a group.\\nHow did MCP help prepare you for high school and college?\\nThe teachers there are like your family, and you are always encouraged to ask the teachers if you need help or to seek guidance from someone you know. I think that mentality really helped me at University School; if you never went in to see the teachers, you might become lost.\\xa0 MCP taught me that my relationships with my teachers are valuable, and that translated to Marquette University as well, where seeking out help is necessary to get to that next level.\\nWhy should parents choose MCP for their children?\\nMilwaukee College Prep is not like other schools. The teachers and students are more connected, and the class sizes are smaller.\\xa0 I also think that the teachers and administrators have really good relationships with parents, and the help is pretty much boundless. They really do prepare you for college—some schools might just go for high attendance numbers, but this school makes you want to be here. If you’re looking for a good, sound education going into high school, this is a school to come to. And they don’t just leave you after 8th grade.\\xa0 There is support during and after high school. I had periodic visits from teachers and administrators checking in on me. Once you go to MCP and leave MCP, it sticks with you.\\nEnroll Now\\nAbout Us\\nEnrollment Process\\nCareers\\nSupport\\nParents\\nStaff Resources\\n36th Street\\n38th Street\\nLloyd Street\\nLola Rowe North\\nMilwaukee College Prep is committed to equal treatment for all individuals.\\n Milwaukee College Prep does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, gender, disability, age, religion, sexual orientation, or national or ethnic origin.\\n\\t\\t\\t©2018 Milwaukee College Prep School.

With uncompromising data driven personalized instruction provided by the best educators, Milwaukee College Prep scholars:\\nOutpace their peers across the state in English Language Arts\\nClose the gap in math a whopping 76%\\nGraduate on time from high performing high schools\\nThis rigorous instruction is balanced with a strong Social Emotional Learning focus building a foundation of:\\nGrit\\nMindfulness\\nGenerosity of spirit\\nIntentional honesty\\nGrowth mindset\\nThis combination of academic rigor and character development transforms our scholars to young adults who are capable of achieving any dream they dream.\\nTransform Our City\\nWe believe education is the civil rights issue of our time. Milwaukee remains one of a few cities that have not successfully made a dent in the largest race-based achievement gap in the nation, and more than 45% of African-American students in Milwaukee are not graduating from high school. These statistics are unconscionable. Aside from the clear personal costs, there is an estimated price tag of about $1.7-$2M to our community over the course of the life-time of every 18 year old that does not graduate from high school in terms of lost tax revenue on lower salaries and increased costs associated with incarceration, unemployment and social services.\\nMilwaukee College Prep is changing that. Consider that 96% of our alumni graduate on time from high school vs. less than 60% of their African-American peers. That is a savings of between $122 million and $144 million for every graduating class of 200 alumni, illustrating that this front-end investment our educators make in our scholars reaps generous rewards for our scholars and our city.\\nTransform Ourselves\\nMCP’s goal is to create an environment where unparalleled teaching flourishes. To that end, we have…\\n1:12 ratio K4-3rd grades\\n1:17 ratio 4-8th grades\\n5 administrators in every building\\nTeacher mentors\\nWeekly Professional Development\\nDedicated Art, Music, PE and IT teachers\\nQuarterly grade level collaboratives\\nHigh quality, intentional personal Skyrocket coaching\\nWeekly Professional Development\\nWe also provide pathways to greater leadership via:\\nEA to Teacher Pipeline: Educational Assistants can earn an expedited and subsidized degree in Education\\nNetwork-wide leadership teams: Educators and Educational Assistants are encouraged to join a specialized leadership team including, but not limited to, SEL Team, ZEARN Team, Wellness Team, Alumni Team, Wit and Wisdom Team, and Mentorship Team\\nJoin Our Team\\nAbout Us\\nEnrollment Process\\nCareers\\nSupport\\nParents\\nStaff Resources\\n36th Street\\n38th Street\\nLloyd Street\\nLola Rowe North\\nMilwaukee College Prep is committed to equal treatment for all individuals.\\n Milwaukee College Prep does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, gender, disability, age, religion, sexual orientation, or national or ethnic origin.\\n\\t\\t\\t©2018 Milwaukee College Prep School.

A school where “knowledge plus character pave the road to college and beyond,” Milwaukee College Prep is absolutely determined to provide equal parts academic rigor and character development so that our scholars can determine their own destinies.\\n20 years ago Milwaukee College Prep opened as a rigorous K4-4th grade school in a city that sorely needed high performing schools. Today, responding to the continued urgent need for uncompromising schools, we have grown to a four-campus network with schools deliberately situated in Milwaukee’s most underserved neighborhoods, educating nearly 2,000 children. We have managed our growth without diluting our effectiveness. In fact, we have seen the reverse, cementing our belief that a rising tide lifts all boats.\\nAdmission at Milwaukee College Prep is based on a blind lottery regardless of prior academic record, conduct, or socioeconomic background. Milwaukee College Prep scholars represent the huge potential of thousands of Milwaukee children just like them. Every day, our scholars prove that Milwaukee need not be home to one of the nation’s largest race-based achievement gaps.\\nPhilosophy: It all begins with great teaching\\nWe absolutely believe, and \\nresearch supports\\n, that an uncompromising K-8 education taught by an exceptional team of teachers is the difference between dreams realized and dreams denied. If a child can’t read, problem-solve, draw inferences, think critically, be self-disciplined and self-determined, that child will not realize his or her dreams…he or she won’t even come close. Having determined, loving, master teachers in every classroom makes the difference.\\nMilwaukee College Prep’s philosophy that children do not fail, schools do, places the bulk of that responsibility squarely on our teachers’ shoulders. Recognizing this, we are committed to putting the best possible teacher in front of every classroom every day and providing that teacher with quality ongoing support and feedback in an environment where great teaching flourishes.\\n\\xa0Collaboration: Reaching beyond our own classrooms\\nWe want to create a revolution in education, but we can’t do it alone. Our ultimate goal is for every child in Milwaukee to receive an uncompromising education. We owe it to them and to ourselves. Our nearly 2,000\\xa0scholars benefit directly, but our reach is far greater. Thanks to our partnership with \\nSchools That Can Milwaukee\\n and our own outreach, we have become a model school welcoming nearly 2,000 teachers and administrators already this year to learn techniques, strategies and philosophies that can be replicated in their own schools.\\nAbout Us\\nEnrollment Process\\nCareers\\nSupport\\nParents\\nStaff Resources\\n36th Street\\n38th Street\\nLloyd Street\\nLola Rowe North\\nMilwaukee College Prep is committed to equal treatment for all individuals.\\n Milwaukee College Prep does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, gender, disability, age, religion, sexual orientation, or national or ethnic origin.\\n\\t\\t\\t©2018 Milwaukee College Prep School.

Most recently, I was Chief School Administration Officer and was charged with overseeing all 160 MPS schools and their school leaders.

We also believe that specialization is the key  to success.\\xa0\\n \\t\\t\\t\\t Accordingly, all students at PODER will train all year around with a certified tennis instructor as part of their school day. They\\xa0will  begin with the basics, learning how to stretch, catch, throw, and move  around the court, and they will undergo activities designed to improve  their hand-eye coordination as well as their overall fitness. Students  will then move into more advanced techniques until they are proficient  enough to compete. The goal is to strengthen the self-reliance and focus  needed for success in college, as well as to produce some of the best  competitive players in the state. \\t\\t\\t\\nLeagues and Tournaments\\n \\t\\t\\t\\t Younger students will have the option of competing in intramural  Quickstart tournaments designed for beginners, while older students will  compete in leagues and tournaments around the state. At a minimum,  students will develop the athletic foundation and confidence needed to  succeed in other sports. But those who decide to stick with tennis will  have the potential to earn college scholarships and potentially move  into professional tennis careers. \\t\\t\\t\\n \\t\\t\\t\\t Private tennis instruction of this kind would ordinarily cost  hundreds of dollars a year. At PODER Academy, students receive this  instruction at no cost. \\t\\t\\t\\nChanges coming to PODER and PASS\\nPODER still\\xa0tops\\xa0in the District\\nNew Library Coming to PODER\\nIn the News\\nPODER Academy Secondary School\\nP.A.S.S.\\nFind\\xa0answers\\xa0to\\xa0frequently asked questions.\\nFAQs\\nPoder Academy\\n2201 Morrie Avenue\\nCheyenne, WY 82001\\n(307) 632-2248\\n(307) 241-6084 (PODER Secondary Phone)\\nOffice Hours\\nMonday-Friday, 8 AM - 5 PM         \\nWebsite Design\\nfrogtummy\\n\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t© 2018 Poder Academy\\n All rights reserved.\\r            '), ('https://poderacademy.com/about-poder-academy', 'False', '1', 'Poder Academy\\nThe Academy\\nThe Mission\\nThe Method\\nThe Results\\nTennis\\nChess\\nPolicies & Procedures\\nStudent & Family Handbook\\nSchool Improvement Plan\\nBoard Meetings\\nThe Team\\nAdministration\\nFaculty\\nBoard of Directors\\nEmployment Opportunities\\nSchedule / Calendar\\nPODER Calendar 17-18\\nP.A.S.S.

It was created in response to parent concerns about continuation for students graduating from PODER elementary.\\nThe school will operate in its own, newly renovated facility located at 1100 Richardson Court. The building was formerly owned by the Park Addition School and the Chaplin School. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, so efforts will be made to retain as much as the original architecture as possible. Further renovations will be made in phases, with plans to include a state-of-the-art indoor gym area.\\xa0\\nP.A.S.S. offers the full \"Basket of Goods\" courses  that are required at other schools in the district. This includes math,  english, social studies, science, and writing. The school will maintain  the same level of structure in place at the elementary school, but will  integrate additional features and supports geared toward older  students.\\nStay tuned for more information!\\nPASS Main number: 307-241-6084\\nChanges coming to PODER and PASS\\nPODER still\\xa0tops\\xa0in the District\\nNew Library Coming to PODER\\nIn the News\\nPODER Academy Secondary School\\nP.A.S.S.\\nFind\\xa0answers\\xa0to\\xa0frequently asked questions.\\nFAQs\\nPoder Academy\\n2201 Morrie Avenue\\nCheyenne, WY 82001\\n(307) 632-2248\\n(307) 241-6084 (PODER Secondary Phone)\\nOffice Hours\\nMonday-Friday, 8 AM - 5 PM         \\nWebsite Design\\nfrogtummy\\n\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t© 2018 Poder Academy\\n All rights reserved.\\r            '), ('https://poderacademy.com/chess', 'False', '1', 'Poder Academy\\nThe Academy\\nThe Mission\\nThe Method\\nThe Results\\nTennis\\nChess\\nPolicies & Procedures\\nStudent & Family Handbook\\nSchool Improvement Plan\\nBoard Meetings\\nThe Team\\nAdministration\\nFaculty\\nBoard of Directors\\nEmployment Opportunities\\nSchedule / Calendar\\nPODER Calendar 17-18\\nP.A.S.S.

It  requires intense focus, discipline, critical thinking and  determination.\\xa0We believe these qualities go hand-in-hand with  academic success, and serve to give students the mental edge needed to  compete in high school and college. We also believe the game of chess  serves to increase the attention span.\\nOur  students will begin with fundamental concepts, learning how each piece  moves, how many points they are worth, and how to achieve a checkmate.  As students are conditioned to think several steps ahead, they will also  learn more advanced offensive and defensive strategies. Students will  practice for one hour every day, all year around, until they are able to  compete on an advanced level.\\nChess Tournaments\\nThere will be opportunities to compete in chess tournaments held in  school and around the city.

The school maintains a belief that specialization is the key to success, and the goal is to strengthen the self-reliance and focus needed for success in college, as well as to produce some of the best competitors in the state. At a minimum, students will develop the foundation needed to succeed in other activities, but those who decide to stick with tennis and chess will have the potential to earn college scholarships, and potentially move into professional careers.\\n Does the school follow Common Core?\\nCommon Core is frequently misperceived and one of the more common  questions.\\xa0In June 2012, the Wyoming State Legislature voted to adopt  the Common Core State Standards as its standards in English/Language  Arts and Math. Therefore, all schools in Wyoming are mandated to meet  these standards. It is then left to each individual school to decide how  to meet those standards, and what curriculum and model is best for  their students. \\n Does the school offer Special Education Services? English Language Learner Services?\\n               In order to facilitate students with special needs, the school works closely with District Special Education  specialists (SPED) to structure individualized behavior plans designed around the  student’s needs. The Individualized Education Program (IEP) team, composed of a  member of the Administrative team, the student’s teacher, and District  Special Education personnel, will take the lead on disciplinary measures concerning  students under their supervision, and develop behavior intervention plans when  necessary in accordance with the student’s IEP. The school also works with the District to provide services and support for ELL students.\\n Is there a fee to enroll at the school?\\nThere is no enrollment fee at PODER Academy. \\n Are the teachers and staff certified at PODER?\\n\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\rIt is a requirement of the school that each\\remployee has the required certifications and/or licensure as stipulated by the\\rWyoming Professional Teaching and Standards Board. These are the same requirements applied to all Wyoming public schools. \\r\\t\\t\\t\\n Do I speak to the Laramie County School Board when I have a concern or complaint about PODER Academy?\\n               PODER Academy is a charter school with independent operating authority, and PODER employees are not considered employees of the Laramie 1 School District. Therefore, the school\\xa0has adopted a Grievance Policy designed to facilitate parent and community concerns in an efficient and judicious manner.\\xa0\\nParent and community members are encouraged to resolve their concerns directly with teachers and staff whenever possible, but will also have the opportunity to appeal to the Administrative team if necessary. If the issue is still not resolved, parent or community members can submit their concern to the PODER Board of Trustees at least one week prior to the next Board meeting. All Board meetings are public, and dates are posted on this website. \\nChanges coming to PODER and PASS\\nPODER still\\xa0tops\\xa0in the District\\nNew Library Coming to PODER\\nIn the News\\nPODER Academy Secondary School\\nP.A.S.S.\\nFind\\xa0answers\\xa0to\\xa0frequently asked questions.\\nFAQs\\nPoder Academy\\n2201 Morrie Avenue\\nCheyenne, WY 82001\\n(307) 632-2248\\n(307) 241-6084 (PODER Secondary Phone)\\nOffice Hours\\nMonday-Friday, 8 AM - 5 PM         \\nWebsite Design\\nfrogtummy\\n\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t© 2018 Poder Academy\\n All rights reserved.\\r            '), ('https://poderacademy.com/the-mission-1', 'False', '1', 'Poder Academy\\nThe Academy\\nThe Mission\\nThe Method\\nThe Results\\nTennis\\nChess\\nPolicies & Procedures\\nStudent & Family Handbook\\nSchool Improvement Plan\\nBoard Meetings\\nThe Team\\nAdministration\\nFaculty\\nBoard of Directors\\nEmployment Opportunities\\nSchedule / Calendar\\nPODER Calendar 17-18\\nP.A.S.S.

The staff will work to  ensure that students have the reading fluency, phonemic awareness, and  comprehension skills needed to move on to the upper grades, and that  students\\xa0have strong mathematic reasoning and problem-solving skills in  all strands by the third grade. The school incorporates teaching  strategies that support intellectual growth, connectivity to the wider  world, and productive classroom environments.\\nPODER is one of the few to offer an\\xa0extended day\\xa0program  where students are dismissed at 5:00pm. The extra hours equate to an  extra month of instructional time over the course of an academic year,  and also provides a structured environment for students between the  hours of 3:00pm to 5:00pm, which is a common window of unsupervised time  for kids with working parents.\\xa0\\nWithin the school, there is a  consistent and unrelenting focus on everything from student posture, to  classwork completeness, to professionalism, all with the goal of  preparing students for the professional mindset. Every aspect of the day  is well structured in order to maximize efficiency, and teachers and  staff are trained to ‘sweat the small stuff’ in order to rectify any  disruptive behavior at its root.\\xa0\\nStudents as young as  kindergarten age will learn how to maintain good study habits, manage  their time, and recognize the appropriate time and place for certain  behavior in the belief that a well-structured school culture goes  hand-in-hand with academic success.\\xa0The underlying goal is to limit  distractions so teachers and students can focus on academics and  preparing for the road to college.\\nChanges coming to PODER and PASS\\nPODER still\\xa0tops\\xa0in the District\\nNew Library Coming to PODER\\nIn the News\\nPODER Academy Secondary School\\nP.A.S.S.\\nFind\\xa0answers\\xa0to\\xa0frequently asked questions.\\nFAQs\\nPoder Academy\\n2201 Morrie Avenue\\nCheyenne, WY 82001\\n(307) 632-2248\\n(307) 241-6084 (PODER Secondary Phone)\\nOffice Hours\\nMonday-Friday, 8 AM - 5 PM         \\nWebsite Design\\nfrogtummy\\n\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t© 2018 Poder Academy\\n All rights reserved.\\r            '), ('https://poderacademy.com/', 'False', '0', '\\r\\t\\t\\t\\tPoder Academy\\r\\t\\t\\t\\nThe Academy\\nThe Mission\\nThe Method\\nThe Results\\nTennis\\nChess\\nPolicies & Procedures\\nStudent & Family Handbook\\nSchool Improvement Plan\\nBoard Meetings\\nThe Team\\nAdministration\\nFaculty\\nBoard of Directors\\nEmployment Opportunities\\nSchedule / Calendar\\nPODER Calendar 17-18\\nP.A.S.S.

Students will master the core subjects in a high-intensity learning environment where tutoring is available to those who need an extra boost, and where English language learners get the support they need.\\xa0\\r\\t\\t\\nThe school adheres to a belief that the road to college begins in the early days of elementary, where students develop the work ethic and discipline needed to achieve academic success.\\xa0High  expectations are set from day one, and students as young as  kindergarten age will learn how to maintain good study habits, manage  their time, and recognize the appropriate time and place\\xa0for certain behavior.\\xa0\\nThe  goal is to limit distractions so teachers and students can focus on  what is important, and that is preparing for the road ahead.\\nChanges coming to PODER and PASS\\nPODER still\\xa0tops\\xa0in the District\\nNew Library Coming to PODER\\nIn the News\\nPODER Academy Secondary School\\nP.A.S.S.\\nFind\\xa0answers\\xa0to\\xa0frequently asked questions.\\nFAQs\\nPoder Academy\\n2201 Morrie Avenue\\nCheyenne, WY 82001\\n(307) 632-2248\\n(307) 241-6084 (PODER Secondary Phone)\\nOffice Hours\\nMonday-Friday, 8 AM - 5 PM         \\nWebsite Design\\nfrogtummy\\n\\r\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t© 2018 Poder Academy\\n All rights reserved.\\r            '), ('https://poderacademy.com/online-registration', 'False', '1', 'Poder Academy\\nThe Academy\\nThe Mission\\nThe Method\\nThe Results\\nTennis\\nChess\\nPolicies & Procedures\\nStudent & Family Handbook\\nSchool Improvement Plan\\nBoard Meetings\\nThe Team\\nAdministration\\nFaculty\\nBoard of Directors\\nEmployment Opportunities\\nSchedule / Calendar\\nPODER Calendar 17-18\\nP.A.S.S.
