Students learn to think for themselves as they answer questions that challenge them on their own or in a group. They are trained to do research, analyze what they have found, and come to conclusions based on what they discover.\\nThe core curriculum provides instruction in all traditional subjects: reading, writing, language studies, math, geometry, science, history, geography, Spanish, music, art, drama, physical education, environmental studies, and computers. The children are also encouraged to care for their environment and practice their practical life skills. “Going out” into their environment is a regular part of their experience.\\nAdults as Helpers\\nTeachers serve as mentors so that students feel they have a voice. Adults are approachable, helpful, and encouraging.\\nChildren as Mentors\\nChildren serve as mentors not only to their classmates but also to the younger children in the school.\\nRich, Integrated Curriculum\\nAs the child progresses through the first, second, and third grades, he is brought more into a curriculum that is research based, introducing them to historical cultures and the sciences.\\nDevelopment of Character\\nPractical life skills support time management by teaching the student how to prioritize studies to completion. Responsibility, integrity, honesty, kindness toward others, respect to all are fostered in real-life scenarios and brought to fruition through years of interaction in a loving and caring community of adults and fellow students.\\n“Going Out” Experiences\\n“Going Out” not only enriches our curriculum, but also teaches the students to expand their environment and utilize the resources in it. These experiences provide the student with the skills to reach out and explore all that is around him.\\nBefore and After School Programs\\nTo meet the needs of working parents, we offer a before and after school program designed for children 18 months to 12 years of age. Every school campus opens at 7:30 AM. Child care is provided until 5:30 PM at Sunnyside, Westside and Switzer Mesa.\\nThe elementary school students may join many special classes offered after school for nominal fees. Classes have included but are not limited to: drama, art, music, athletic activities, dance, yoga, and community service projects. Middle school students have an opportunity to participate in competitive sports such as volleyball, soccer, basketball and cross country as well as form clubs such as a Book Club or a Chess Club.\\nSummer Program\\nOur summer program is held in sessions during the summer months at the Sunnyside Campus for children ages 18 months to 6 years. The Montessori-based program is designed to give the children a rich summer experience with an extensive outdoor environment program. Gardening, art, music, drama, cooking, woodworking, water activities, “going out” adventures, as well as community resource visitors complement the Montessori curriculum and materials.\\nCall the Sunnyside campus for the summer session schedules. Registration can be for one or two sessions, 3 or 5 days, full or part-time.\\nSwitzer Mesa Campus\\n850 N.

The teachers and current elementary students who welcomed the kindergartners were just as eager to meet the new members of their classroom communities.\\xa0\\nThe students played a game in order to learn their new friends' names and then worked together on a creative project. A couple of the classrooms did a folding and cutting lesson, while another tried origami. The older children did a great job helping the future first years with their projects and many new friendships were made! After taking a tour of the school, the students headed outside to learn more about the playground. The future first years were very eager to try out the much bigger playground equipment. When it was time for the kindergartners to leave, many were sad to go. It won't be long before these students are official First Years at our campus and we are looking forward to them joining our community!\\nHere are some photos from their visit to the Switzer Mesa Campus:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA-3 Spring Things: Triops in Our Classroom!\\t\\t\\t\\nTriops are very unusual creatures with two dark compound eyes and a third pale eye between them.\\xa0 That is why they are called triops for the three eyes (from the Greek, tri for three and ops for eyes).\\xa0 With these eyes they can detect food or predators very near to them.\\xa0 Triops eat algae, mosquito larva, tadpoles, fairy shrimp and other smaller and weaker triops!\\xa0 Triops make their natural homes in vernal pools called “potholes” where their life span is about 50-90 days.\\xa0 They are also called living fossils since they have been around since the time of the earliest dinosaurs (about 200 million years ago).\\xa0 They are relatives of trilobites and horseshoe crabs.\\nOur class is trying to raise these creatures from small eggs.\\xa0 We had a few hatch, but the flies that accidentally hatched in our worm factory ate the tiny hatched triops—what a catastrophe!\\xa0 This week we are going to try again since the flies are gone.\\xa0 We have to make sure the water temperature is right and this time cover the container so the flies eat no more!\\nBy: Astrid, grade 3\\nimage from commons.wikimedia.org\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tUpper Elementary Water Conservation Essays\\t\\t\\t\\nOur classes and a few others around Flagstaff are having a very exciting competition to see who can write the most persuasive, but fascinating essay based on Water Conservation.

Our goal is now, and has always been, to develop Renaissance children.\\nThe Montessori Charter School of Flagstaff was the first school in Arizona to have its application for a charter approved by the Arizona State Board for Charter Schools. The school has been operating continuously since 1995. Our four campuses serve over 360 children from 18 months (non-charter preschool) through 14 years of age (charter middle school). We offer a very strong academic program that recognizes and addresses each childâ\\x80\\x99s individual social and emotional development.\\nAlthough we have never stressed â\\x80\\x9cthe testâ\\x80\\x9d as a means of evaluating children, our standardized test scores have always been among the best in the state.\\nThe classroom community\\nEach classroom, depending on the level, can have up to three (including two assistant) teachers. At our middle school, three main teachers, who educate children in the core subjects, are joined by specialists in art, music, dance, drama, cooking, yoga, self-defense, scrapbooking, Spanish, computers, physical education, environmental science, and other subjects.\\nEach student follows a unique and personalized learning plan designed by our faculty. Within each classroom, the childrenâ\\x80\\x99s ages span 3 years. The younger children benefit from mentoring, and the older students continue to grow academically while developing leadership skills and reinforcing what they have already mastered by sharing their knowledge.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAbout the Name â\\x80\\x9cMontessoriâ\\x80\\x9d\\t\\t\\t\\nThe name â\\x80\\x9cMontessoriâ\\x80\\x9d is in the public domain. Anyone can use it and claim to be a â\\x80\\x9cMontessori School.â\\x80\\x9d Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why we encourage you to do your homework before you enroll your child anywhere.\\nVisit the school.\\nAsk your friends who have recent experience with the school.\\nContact the agency responsible for overseeing the school (for example, the Arizona State Board for Charter Schools or the Arizona Department of Health Services, etc.).\\nCheck the staffâ\\x80\\x99s credentials, training, and experience.\\nChoose the school with a history of success with alumni that possess the qualities you most want for your child.\\nPlease be aware that some schools advertise themselves as â\\x80\\x9cMontessori Inspiredâ\\x80\\x9d or â\\x80\\x9cMontessori Based.â\\x80\\x9d Although these may be fine schools, they are not Montessori Schools.\\nAnd so we discovered that education is not something which the teacher does, but that it is a natural process which develops spontaneously in the human being. It is not acquired by listening to words, but in virtue of experiences in which the child acts on his environment. The teacherâ\\x80\\x99s task is not to talk, but to prepare and arrange . . . a special environment made for the child. \\n â\\x80\\x94Dr. Montessori, The Absorbent Mind\\nMontessori Philosophy\\nThe Montessori Philosophy encourages children to develop their observation skills through activities that use the five senses, kinetic movement, spatial refinement, small and gross motor skill coordination, and concrete knowledge that leads to later abstraction.\\nRead More...\\nArizona School Tax Credit\\nThe 2015 Arizona School Tax Credit lets your donation go directly to a public school of your choice!
