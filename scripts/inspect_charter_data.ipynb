Charter schools vary in mission and model, serving a wide range of students, many with needs beyond the one-size-fits-all traditional public school. Often, charter schools provide a personalized learning environment that promotes greater student achievement. Although charter schools have some autonomy, they still must meet the rigorous academic standards dictated by the state for all public schools. \\nHow are charter schools funded?\\nCharter Schools receive state funds based on the average daily attendance of students (same as traditional schools); however, they do not receive funds from local tax revenue and the majorities, including Texas charters, do not receive state facilities funding. Texas Education Agency (TEA) data indicated that charter schools receive approximately $1,200* less in total revenue per pupil than traditional public schools. (*Based on TEA Snapshot 2009)\\nCharter Schools in Texas: \\nCharter Schools were authorized by the Texas Legislature in 1995 to provide an alternative to traditional public schools. Currently, Texas has a 215 state cap on charters. In the state of Texas, charter schools operate under and receive academic accountability ratings from the Texas Education Agency. All charter students in Texas take the same Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) test as traditional public school students. \\nWhat is the purpose of charter schools?\\nImprove student learning\\nIncrease the choice of learning opportunities within the public school system\\nCreate professional opportunities that will attract new teachers to the public school system\\nEstablish a new form of accountability for public schools\\nEncourage different and innovative learning meth\\no\\nd\\ns\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright © 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

Parents/guardians of new students must complete a Pre-Admission Form provided at the front desk of the school. An enrollment interview with an Arlington Classics Academy administrator is encouraged before the student starts class. During the interview, academic standards, dress code, attendance policies, and general school operations will be discussed.\\nAn enrollment packet must then be completed and the application process is not be finalized until all forms and required data are obtained. Arlington Classics Academy will review the student’s discipline history from the last enrolled school, and may exclude the student from admission on this basis. It is the responsibility of the parent to ensure that all forms as listed in the enrollment packet (eg: report card, discipline record) are submitted to the school in a timely manner to be considered for enrollment. Existing students will be required to complete an application/re-enrollment packet, including residency verification, in the spring semester of each year for the following year.\\nThe initial enrollment period for each school year is from February 1 through 6:00 pm on the last school day of February. Siblings of current students and children of employees will be considered first to fill any existing openings, then all other completed Pre-Admission\\nForms submitted during this period will receive equal consideration for admission to ACA. Note: ACA does not guarantee that multiple siblings will be accepted at the same time. It may be necessary that a sibling has to remain on the waiting list until an opening is available for a specific grade level.\\nAfter 6:00 pm on the last school day of February, the Pre-Admission Forms will be sorted by grade and counted. If the number of completed forms for a grade is less than or equal to the number of openings for that grade, all students who have submitted the forms will be offered admission. However, if the number of completed forms for a grade exceeds the number of openings for that grade, there will be a lottery.\\nThe lottery will determine which students are offered admission and the waitlist order for the remaining students. It is the responsibility of the parent to ensure receipt of pre-admission or lottery application forms. Any potential student(s) whose forms are not fully received (completed forms properly submitted to appropriate staff) will forfeit any rights to the lottery and will be added to the end of the appropriate wait list.\\nAny Pre-Admission Forms submitted after the last school day of February will automatically go to the bottom of the waitlist, should a waitlist exist for that grade. When there has been a change in residency, it is the responsibility of the parents to notify the campus administration immediately.\\xa0\\nNo person shall be excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination, harassment or retaliation in any ARLINGTON CLASSICS ACADEMY\\xa0program\\xa0on the basis of age; race, color, or national origin; sex, gender, or gender identity; or disability, or relationship or association with an individual with a disability; or any other basis protected by law.\\xa0\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright © 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

ACA was founded and is guided by parents who sought a better education for their children. Without parental support and involvement, ACA\\'s vision cannot be achieved.\\nWe believe that parents should be involved in their child\\'s education. Each staff member, teacher and parent has a critical role. Ultimately, the school depends upon the family. We welcome and encourage parent participation on every level for the betterment of our students. Volunteers are an important part of the ACA culture. Volunteerism can take on many forms and ACA welcomes them all.\\nThe Parent-Teacher Organization is a vital part of ACA\\'s success. The objectives of the PTO are to support the charter of Arlington Classics Academy, support with the highest priority the high academic goals and achievements, to provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of general education information and to build a sense of community among students, staff and parents. \\xa0 For more information, visit www.acapto.com.\\xa0\\nIt is vital to Arlington Classics Academy that parents of ACA students be involved in campus based and district based decision making, improvement plans, and policy revisions. If you are interested in participating in any committee for an ACA campus or a district-wide committee, please contact the campus principal or the Executive Director of Schools, Craig Sims, at csims@acaedu.net.\\nThe Parent Involvement Policy and guidelines are evaluated annually by the district advisory committee, a committee made up of parents, staff and other ACA stakeholders. \\xa0Below are the most recent and final policies and guidelines related to parental involvement:\\nBoard Policy: Parental Involvement\\xa0\\n(click here)\\nParent-School Compact \\n(click here )\\nParent and Student Expectations\\xa0\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that the Vision of ACA is to be an educational institution of academic excellence that provides a liberal arts curriculum delivered through a classical style of instruction.\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that the Mission of ACA is to equip a diverse student body with a commanding knowledge of western civilization, the origins of liberty, and the ability to sustain that liberty through moral leadership.\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that ACA is a \"school of choice\" designed to provide a rigorous and academically challenging curriculum not typically provided in traditional public schools, with a variety of unique policies and procedures that support its educational mission.\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that enrollment into ACA is evidence of this agreement and the agreement to abide by any and all of ACA\\'s policies, procedures, and expectations.\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that students are required to wear only approved uniforms to school each and every school day.\\xa0\\n\\xa0How can I be involved in my child\\'s education?\\nThere are at least 100 ways you can be involved in your child\\'s education! \\xa0These were adapted from the National Standards for Parent/Family Involvement Programs.

It\\'s hard to believe, but this will be my 28th year in education. \\xa0I began my career as a first grade teacher, then later went on to become a school guidance counselor, working at the elementary and junior high level, and have spent the past 11 years as an elementary administrator. \\xa0\\nI grew up in a small town and my roots are simple...faith, family, and serving others before yourself.\\xa0 My husband & I live in Arlington and we have two children.\\xa0 Our oldest, Haven is a Freshman at Southern Nazarene University in Bethany, Oklahoma where she plays volleyball and is majoring in nursing, and our youngest, Holden is a Freshman at Grace Prep Academy.\\xa0\\xa0We love to travel any chance we can get, but when we\\'re home, we\\'re usually in a gym or on a field cheering on our kid\\'s sporting events, or serving at our local church home. \\xa0\\nI firmly believe that everything must first be relational before it\\'s functional, so I am very intentional about building relationships, being available & transparent, and doing what\\'s best for kids at all times.\\xa0 Thank you for partnering with ACA and helping your child be the best they can.\\xa0 I look forward to\\xa0getting to know you and your family better & making \"Griffin memories\" along the way\\n. \\xa0\\nMrs. Teri Rodgers\\xa0\\n\\xa0Haleakala Crater\\n(Sunset on Maui Volcano, 2016)\\n2800B W.

There are three fundamental keys to accomplishing this:\\nStaff Development We hire dedicated, hard-working, creative teachers and staff who understand the effort required to fulfill our mission. We encourage teachers to look for new and better ways to teach. Our teachers are committed to the principles of childhood development, multiple intelligences, and learner readiness to ensure the academic success of the child. The ACA teacher will be committed to being life-long learners themselves, particularly with regard to learning new strategies for aiding student understanding and mastery of the subject content.\\nCurriculum Development\\nWe are required by the Texas Education Agency (TEA) to teach the TEKS curriculum that is taught in all public schools in the state. However, our curriculum is not limited to the minimum requirements. The school’s educational goal is to develop students who are fully armed with all the tools western civilization offers. These tools include a clear understanding of American culture and those that preceded it. We believe that the western world is foremost responsible for handing down the basis for our culture, our liberty, and our social customs. Our culture has grown from the heritage of the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans to its current state.\\nThe CK curriculum addresses these integral educational goals and is paramount to ACA’s enriched curriculum. Along with the knowledge of our past and present, ACA will strive to ensure that its students understand the development and importance of our civil rights and freedoms in the maintenance of our society. Students will be taught the importance of individual actions – that one person can and should make a difference in our world. By the study of world leaders, this fundamental truth will be taught so that students will understand that their own daily habits, actions, and personal philosophy affect the immediate environment, and ultimately the world in which they live.\\nThe ACA curriculum incorporates a structured grammar program that provides a foundation for even the youngest of our students. ACA believes in a strong phonics based program but does recognize the need for a balanced literacy approach to helping students learn to read at the earliest possible age. All language arts curriculum taught at ACA is research developed and backed to ensure its effectiveness in teaching language skills that prepare students to study and master the finer points of the English language.\\nThe kind of attention given to the Language Arts curriculum is also given to the Math, Social Studies, and Science programs as well. All curriculum disciplines are scrutinized for content and alignment before they are accepted and incorporated as an integral part of the ACA curriculum. What we also look for in all ACA curriculum is the insurance that the process of teaching that curriculum leads to the development of higher order thinking skills in areas of reason and logic, analysis and synthesis.\\nIn addition, beginning in kindergarten, ACA students are taught music and art. The goal in these subjects is to afford the students generous opportunities to gain intimate familiarity with their beauty, history, and impact on our culture.\\nSpanish is offered beginning at the kindergarten level, serving as a practical tool in our modern world. Ultimately, as the school grows, Latin will be taught to enhance a deeper understanding and appreciation of the roots of our language and the sciences.\\nFinally, a physical education program is offered at all grades levels. Kinesthetic and motor skill development and lessons needed for lifelong physical wellness aid in the complete development of the child.\\nThe aggregation of this entire body of knowledge - the arts, the sciences, the languages, and physical education - embody what the ancient Greeks considered as teaching the entire child, mind, body, and soul.\\nEvaluation and Assessment Methods\\nThe most important element of our philosophy is our commitment to the relentless realization of our vision. ACA board members, administration, staff, parents, and students are encouraged to constantly look for ways to improve our school and, ultimately, student performance. Every voice counts in the support and realization of that improvement and in our effort to provide the best possible education for our students. This effort can result in occasional challenges as we evaluate our performance, but this constant and relentless assessment of our progress inevitably leads to improvement.\\nEvaluation and assessment also speaks to the way a determination is made regarding student performance. ACA teachers will consider strategic ways to ensure that what is being taught is what is being learned. Evaluation and assessment can take on a number of forms regarding performance and the ACA teacher will work to ensure that assessment, regardless of format, reflects knowledge learned by the student.\\nAcademic Principles at ACA\\nACA will use a combination of three sources for its teaching material, including Core Knowledge.\\xa0\\n\\xa0We will use the Trivium style of classical teaching whenever possible.\\nDr. E. D. Hirsch developed the Core Knowledge curriculum in 1986. A sequenced set of goals for K-8th grades make up its center, and teachers all over the world share in developing lesson plans based upon those goals.\\nThe Trivium style of teaching recognizes that children generally follow a predictable pattern of learning as they grow, and working within this pattern allows teachers to maximize their efforts. This pattern is generally considered to comprise three stages: grammar, logic, and rhetoric. In the grammar stage, children learn facts. In the logic stage, the pupils learn reasoning. Lastly, in the rhetoric stage, students are encouraged to use their factual knowledge and reasoning skills to be creative.\\nThe Trivium discusses the method by which students are taught, but does not specify what subjects are being taught. The combination of the curricula, provide a style of teaching that meshes well with a curriculum rich in factual knowledge.\\nOther Curriculum Information Links\\nAdvantages of D\\'Nealian Handwiring\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright © 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

This school year, your monthly menu will focus on a Texas grown product. Each month we will choose an item to learn more about and that item will also be featured on the menu that month. Be sure to try menu items which are TEXAS GROWN! \\nTEXAS: \\nSpinach is thought to have originated in ancient Persia in today’s Iran. It made its way to China in the 7\\nth \\ncentury. Spinach was recorded in Europe as early as the mid-13\\nth \\ncentury and colonists brought spinach seed with them to the New World. \\nTexas is number three in the United States in spinach production and provides about 30% of all spinach in the United States. Spinach is grown in several regions in Texas including the Winter Garden region (Southwest of San Antonio), the Lower Rio Grande Valley (McAllen-Harlingen) and the Pan Handle (Lubbock). Spinach is a very hardy crop and thrives in cool, moist conditions. Although spinach is readily available through-out the year, its primary growing season is March through May and September through October. \\nFOOD OF THE MONTH: SPINACH \\nSpinach is a \"super-food\" with nearly twice as much protein, calcium, iron, potassium, Vitamin A, Vitamin B and B2, niacin and Vitamin C as most other leafy greens. Spinach is also very high in Vitamin K which is important for bone health. Calorie for calorie, leafy green vegetables like spinach provide more nutrients than many other foods. \\nOverview of the USDA Smart Snacks Rule\\nChild Nutrition Policy from Texas Department of Agriculture\\nPolicy Brochure from TDA\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright © 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

Ask their doctor about spacers today!\\nEarly symptoms of asthma can include:\\nShortness of breath, especially with activity,\\nInability to stand or sit still,\\nRestless sleep,\\nComplaint of the chest feeling \"tight\"\\nLate (urgent - call 911!!) symptoms of asthma include:\\nChanges in color - student appears to be blue or gray in the face, lips, and nail beds,\\nUse of inhaler is ineffective,\\nVisible \"pulling in\" during inhalation between rib bones, and bones in the neck,\\nThese are known as \"retractions,\" and are a better indicator of the severity of airway inflammation than is wheezing!\\nPeak Flow is in orange or red zones,\\nNasal flaring\\nIf you have a pulse oximeter at home, do not use this as the only assessment tool!\\nEnsure that it is designed for pediatrics\\nLiving at home with smokers increases risks of asthma attacks\\nRoughly 40% of asthmatics that present to the ER live with smokers!\\nAsthma Triggers\\nPlease speak with your child\\'s doctor about starting an asthma action plan. If they already have one, please provide that to your child\\'s school nurse so he or she can better care for your student!\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright © 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

Talk your own families to find out about how your grandparents and great- grandparents were affected by the depression. How were their experiences similar and different from Bud’s? \\nHerman E. Calloway always made sure that one member of his band was white. Why was it important for him to have a white band member? What could a white man do in the 1930s that a black man wasn\\'t allowed to do? Has that changed today?\\nThe Great Depression took place before people had televisions. Movies and live entertainment, like jazz bands, were especially important in helping people forget their own hardships. Go to your community library or look online for some CDs of 1930s jazz. You might want to listen to Betty Carter, the musical inspiration for Miss Thomas, or Billie Holiday, another legendary jazz singer. How does this music compare to today\\'s popular music?\\nBud\\'s story takes place during the 1930s, when orphanages are still common and lots of children and families have lost everything due to the Great Depression. How do you think life would be different for Bud if he was growing up today?\\nThe Watsons Go to Birmingham - 1963 by\\xa0Christopher Paul Curtis\\xa0(Grades\\xa06-8 Essential Questions)\\nWhy is the theme of familial love so powerful in this novel? How is it developed?\\nIn what ways does Kenny change over the course of the novel? Support your answer with evidence from the text.\\nIn what ways does Byron change over the course of the novel?

D. Hirsch, Jr., author of The Schools We Need, and is based on a large body of research in cognitive psychology, as well as a careful examination of several of the world\\'s fairest and most effective school systems.\\nDr. Hirsch has argued that, for the sake of academic excellence, greater fairness, and higher literacy, early schooling should provide a solid, specific, shared core curriculum in order to help children establish strong foundations of knowledge. After wide consultation, the content of this core curriculum has been outlined in two books -- the \\nCore Knowledge Preschool Sequence and the \\nCore Knowledge Sequence, K-8-- that state explicitly what students should learn at each grade level. Currently, hundreds of schools and thousands of dedicated educators are participating in this school reform movement throughout the United States.\\nResources for Understanding the Core Knowledge Curriculum:\\nThe Core Knowledge Sequence: Content guidelines for Grades K-8: A comprehensive topic guide to the curriculum.\\nThe Core Knowledge Grader Series: \\nWhat Your Kindergartner - Sixth Grader Needs to Know\\n(click on book to be taken to the Core Knowledge Bookstore website)\\nBooks to Build On: A Grade-by-Grade Guide for Parents and Teachers\\n - An annotated list of books that compliment the Core Knowledge curriculum. Several hundred additions to this list are presented on the website.\\nCore Classics - Illustrated classics abridged for young readers but faithful in style and substance to the original works.\\nOn\\nwww.coreknowledge.org\\nyou can:\\nread articles about the curriculum \\norder resource materials \\nsubscribe to the Foundation\\'s e-newsletter,\\n Common Knowledge \\nBooks by E. D. Hirsch, Jr.:\\nCultural Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know \\nThe Dictionary of Cultural Literacy,\\n Edited by E. D.

The early years of school are spent in absorbing facts, systematically laying the foundations for advanced study. In the middle grades, students learn to think through arguments. In the high school years, they learn to express themselves. This classical pattern is called the trivium.\\nThe first years of schooling are called the \"grammar stage\" -- not because you spend four years doing English, but because these are the years in which the building blocks for all other learning are laid, just as grammar is the foundation for language. In the elementary school years -- what we commonly think of as grades one through four -- the mind is ready to absorb information. Children at this age actually find memorization fun. So during this period, education involves not self-expression and self-discovery, but rather the learning of facts. Rules of phonics and spelling, rules of grammar, poems, the vocabulary of foreign languages, the stories of history and literature, descriptions of plants and animals and the human body, the facts of mathematics -- the list goes on. This information makes up the \"grammar,\" or the basic building blocks, for the second stage of education.\\nBy fifth grade, a child\\'s mind begins to think more analytically. Middle-school students are less interested in finding out facts than in asking \"Why?\" The second phase of the classical education, the \"Logic Stage,\" is a time when the child begins to pay attention to cause and effect, to the relationships between different fields of knowledge relate, to the way facts fit together into a logical framework.\\nA student is ready for the Logic Stage when the capacity for abstract thought begins to mature. During these years, the student begins algebra and the study of logic, and begins to apply logic to all academic subjects. The logic of writing, for example, includes paragraph construction and learning to support a thesis; the logic of reading involves the criticism and analysis of texts, not simple absorption of information; the logic of history demands that the student find out why the War of 1812 was fought, rather than simply reading its story; the logic of science requires that the child learn the scientific method.\\nThe final phase of a classical education, the \"Rhetoric Stage,\" builds on the first two. At this point, the high school student learns to write and speak with force and originality. The student of rhetoric applies the rules of logic learned in middle school to the foundational information learned in the early grades and expresses his conclusions in clear, forceful, elegant language. Students also begin to specialize in whatever branch of knowledge attracts them; these are the years for art camps, college courses, foreign travel, apprenticeships, and other forms of specialized training.\\nA classical education is more than simply a pattern of learning, though. Classical education is language-focused; learning is accomplished through words, written and spoken, rather than through images (pictures, videos, and television).\\nWhy is this important? Language-learning and image-learning require very different habits of thought. Language requires the mind to work harder; in reading, the brain is forced to translate a symbol (words on the page) into a concept. Images, such as those on videos and television, allow the mind to be passive. In front of a video screen, the brain can \"sit back\" and relax; faced with the written page, the mind is required to roll its sleeves up and get back to work.\\nA classical education, then, has two important aspects. It is language-focused. And it follows a specific three-part pattern: the mind must be first supplied with facts and images, then given the logical tools for organization of facts, and finally equipped to express conclusions.\\nBut that isn\\'t all. To the classical mind, all knowledge is interrelated. Astronomy (for example) isn\\'t studied in isolation; it\\'s learned along with the history of scientific discovery, which leads into the church\\'s relationship to science and from there to the intricacies of medieval church history. The reading of the Odyssey leads the student into the consideration of Greek history, the nature of heroism, the development of the epic, and man\\'s understanding of the divine.\\nThis is easier said than done. The world is full of knowledge, and finding the links between fields of study can be a mind-twisting task. A classical education meets this challenge by taking history as its organizing outline -- beginning with the ancients and progressing forward to the moderns in history, science, literature, art and music.\\nWe suggest that the twelve years of education consist of three repetitions of the same four-year pattern: Ancients, Middle Ages, Renaissance and Reformation, and Modern Times. The child studies these four time periods at varying levels -- simple for grades 1-4, more difficult in grades 5-8 (when the student begins to read original sources), and taking an even more complex approach in grades 9-12, when the student works through these time periods using original sources (from Homer to Hitler) and also has the opportunity to pursue a particular interest (music, dance, technology, medicine, biology, creative writing) in depth.\\nThe other subject areas of the curriculum are linked to history studies. The student who is working on ancient history will read Greek and Roman mythology, the tales of the Iliad and Odyssey, early medievial writings, Chinese and Japanese fairy tales, and (for the older student) the classical texts of Plato, Herodutus, Virgil, Aristotle. She\\'ll read Beowulf, Dante, Chaucer, Shakespeare the following year, when she\\'s studying medieval and early Renaissance history. When the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries are studied, she starts with Swift (Gulliver\\'s Travels) and ends with Dickens; finally, she reads modern literature as she is studying modern history.\\nThe sciences are studied in a four-year pattern that roughly corresponds to the periods of scientific discovery: biology, classification and the human body (subjects known to the ancients); earth science and basic astronomy (which flowered during the early Renaissance); chemistry (which came into its own during the early modern period); and then basic physics and computer science (very modern subjects).\\nThis pattern lends coherence to the study of history, science, and literature -- subjects that are too often fragmented and confusing. The pattern widens and deepens as the student progresses in maturity and learning. For example, a first grader listens to you read the story of the Iliad from one of the picture book versions available at any public library. Four years later, the fifth grader reads one of the popular middle-grade adaptations -- Olivia Coolidge\\'s The Trojan War, or Roger Lancelyn Greene\\'s Tales of Troy. Four more years go by, and the ninth grader -- faced with the Iliad itself -- plunges right in, undaunted.\\nThe classical education is, above all, systematic -- in direct contrast to the scattered, unorganized nature of so much secondary education. This systematic, rigorous study has two purposes.\\nRigorous study develops virtue in the student. Aristotle defined virtue as the ability to act in accordance to what one knows to be right. The virtuous man (or woman) can force himself to do what he knows to be right, even when it runs against his inclinations. The classical education continually asks a student to work against his baser inclinations (laziness, or the desire to watch another half hour of TV) in order to reach a goal -- mastery of a subject.\\nSystematic study also allows the student to join what Mortimer Adler calls the \"Great Conversation\" -- the ongoing conversation of great minds down through the ages. Much modern education is so eclectic that the student has little opportunity to make connections between past events and the flood of current information. \"The beauty of the classical curriculum,\" writes classical schoolmaster David Hicks, \"is that it dwells on one problem, one author, or one epoch long enough to allow even the youngest student a chance to exercise his mind in a scholarly way: to make connections and to trace developments, lines of reasoning, patterns of action, recurring symbolisms, plots, and motifs.\"\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright © 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

The team will create a signal that lets the audience know which vehicle is about to travel and deliver a part. The parts will be assembled into a pet animal. Once assembly is completed, the animal will perform a trick. The theme of the presentation must include the delivery of the parts, the assembly, and the pet an\\nimal.\\nProblem 5: It’s How You Look At It\\nCoach & Coordinator: Suzanne Rieter\\nMeetings: Mondays at Bowen (4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.)\\nThe team’s problem is to create and present an original humorous performance that includes two characters that act naturally -- to them -- but odd to those around them. One scene will establish the \"normal\" behavior of one character that, at some point in the performance, finds itself among others who react to the out-of-place behavior. The other character\\'s behavior will stand out too, but this character will end up in a setting where its odd behavior is considered normal. The performance will also include a meter that indicates the degree of odd/normal behavior and a creative scene change.\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright © 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

Tests for mathematics and reading are available for grades K-8 and science and language usage are available for grades 2-8. \\xa0These tests yield a national percentile score as well as a growth scale score (RIT).\\xa0 ACA can administer MAP in the fall, winter, and spring, though which tests are given at which times are largely campus decisions.\\nThe MAP RIT Scale (\\n2015 Norms\\n)\\nThe RIT Scale is a curriculum scale that uses individual item difficulty values to estimate student achievement. An advantage of the RIT scale is that it can relate the numbers on the scale directly to the difficulty of items on the tests. In addition, the RIT scale is an equal interval scale. Equal interval means that the difference between scores is the same regardless of whether a student is at the top, bottom, or middle of the RIT scale, and it has the same meaning regardless of grade level. RIT scales, like scales underlying most educational tests, are built from data about the performance of individual examinees on individual items.\\nMAP tests produce scores that make it possible to monitor student growth from year to year along developmental curriculum scales. The RIT Charts show examples of the kinds of work students can do at various points along the NWEA RIT scale, assuming they have been exposed to the content. This type of information is helpful in supporting appropriate instruction. \\xa0All MAP tests are based on the state curriculum for Texas (TEKS - Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills).\\nFAQs\\nWhere can I learn more about NWEA MAP?\\nYou can visit their website at\\n\\xa0https://www.nwea.org/assessments/map/\\n.\\nWhat resources are available to me as a parent?\\xa0\\nA Parent\\'s Guide to MAP\\nA Parent\\'s Guide To MAP (Spanish)\\nRIT Reference Chart - MPG\\nRIT Reference Chart - MAP\\nTo use the RIT Reference Charts, find the range that contains your child\\'s RIT score for the appropriate grade and test. \\xa0The RIT Reference Charts (MPG for Primary, MAP for Intermediate and Middle School) show an example item that your student is working on at each RIT range. \\xa0\\nFor the RIT Reference Chart, the range in which the RIT score falls is the current instructional level. \\xa0Items below that RIT range are assumed to have been already learned and items above the RIT range are new topics to be introduced.\\nThere is also a wonderful resource page put together by a district in Wisconsin that gives links to online practice resources by RIT score and goal strand.\\nMath by RIT score\\nMath by Goal Strand\\xa0\\nReading by RIT score\\xa0\\nReading by Goal Strand\\xa0\\nWhat happened to the ITBS (Iowa Test of Basic Skills)?\\xa0\\nACA elected to replace the yearly testing of students with ITBS with the NWEA MAP for three main reasons. \\xa0First, the ITBS could only be given once a year. \\xa0The information gained from the test garnered a wealth of information about what students did or did not know but its infrequency did not make it useful in impacting instruction. \\xa0On the other hand, NWEA MAP can be given up to three times a year and this frequency will help us track student growth and make adjustments to our instruction during the school year. \\xa0Second, ITBS was aligned to Common Core State Standards and was testing our students on a curriculum that we don\\'t teach. \\xa0NWEA MAP though is aligned to our state TEKS so we are assessing what we are teaching. \\xa0Finally, the ITBS was a static test that asked the same questions year after year. \\xa0If the test was too easy for some students, it had a hard ceiling past which we could not track their level of understanding. \\xa0The NWEA MAP is a computer-based adaptive test. \\xa0What that means is that test items are drawn from an item bank and the difficulty of the questions changes based on how successful the students are being. \\xa0As a student answers the questions correctly, the \\nitems become increasingly challenging until the instructional level of the child has been determined.\\nIs the MAP assessment a norm-referenced\\xa0assessment?\\xa0\\xa0\\nYes, the MAP assessment is nationally normed every 3 or 4 years (most recently in 2015). \\xa0This allows for comparison of student scores to the \"average\" scores of other students in the same grade from a wide variety of school across the country. \\xa0This will help serve as a starting point for teachers to review data and gain a better of a child\\'s current instructional level.\\nHow will ACA use the RIT scores my child received on the MAP assessments?\\nMAP scores help teachers and administrators determine the current instructional level of each student. \\xa0In knowing this, lessons can be designed that provide for students at all levels within the same classroom setting. \\xa0By knowing where every student stand in each objective area, teachers are better equipped with tools that allow them to design flexible groups and differentiated lessons to meet each student where they are on the learning continuum and help move them forward. \\xa0With this data, teacher can support struggling learners, more accurately plan on-grade-level instruction, and enrich students who are moving faster than others. \\xa0With several assessments taken throughout the year, teachers now have a nationally-normed objective test with which to track individual student progress and interpret strengths and weaknesses.\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright © 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

They are about 2-3 mm long. They are\\rfound in the hair near the scalp and can cause intense itching and skin\\rirritation by biting the scalp. Lice will leave eggs on the hair mostly behind\\rthe ears and at the nape of the neck. These eggs are small spots that are glued\\ron the hair close to the scalp, and are difficult to see and remove. Eggs will\\rhatch every 7-12 days, and the young lice will reach full maturity 9-12 days\\rafter hatching. Hatched eggs, or nits, can be seen as small white spots on the\\rhair strands, and are usually farther away from the scalp as viable eggs are.\\rLice can survive for only less than 24 hours without a food source (i.e. a\\rhuman head).\\xa0\\r\\r\\nThere are some common misconceptions about lice. For\\rinstance, head lice do not hop, jump, or fly; they crawl, and prefer to be on\\rsomeone’s head. They move from child to child through head to head contact, or\\rvery rarely by sharing items such as combs, hair brushes, pillows, or hats;\\rmost lice or eggs on brushes or combs have been found to be injured or damaged,\\rand unviable. Lice do not carry or spread any diseases. Additionally, hair\\rlength has been found to have no effect on lice infestations.\\xa0\\nAlthough there is currently no Texas statute regulating\\rpediculosis, we require any student with evidence of live lice to be sent home\\rand treated. If only nits are found, the school nurse will communicate with the\\rparent, and the decision to remove the student from class will be left at the\\rparent’s discretion.\\xa0Please do not preventatively treat your child. Some of the treatments\\r(i.e. Rid, Nix, etc.), if used incorrectly, or more than recommended, can be\\rharmful to your child. Treat only if you find lice or eggs. If\\ryou find that your student is affected, check the rest of your household, and\\rtreat all members who are affected.\\xa0\\nTo detect lice, separate the hair in sections and look\\rclosely for either live bugs, or eggs on the hair. Eggs or nits close to the\\rscalp can be indicative of an active case. If the nits are further out in the\\rstrands, it is possible that the case has diminished, but will still need to be\\rtreated. To distinguish eggs and nits from dandruff, rub a finger over the\\rarea. If the spot moves, it is dandruff. Please do not feel that your, or any\\rother child, is “dirty,” if he/she has lice; they prefer clean hair because it\\rallows them to better hold on to the hair shafts.\\xa0\\nWe DO NOT recommend using the\\raforementioned treatments, or anything as extreme as pet insect killers like\\rAdvantage. However, if you choose to use those treatments, please be sure to\\ruse them sparingly and exactly as directed on the packaging. There are natural\\rtreatments available, such as hot oil, olive, tea tree, or peppermint oils.\\rWash your child’s hair with hot water (but not hot enough to burn). With a\\rfine-toothed lice comb (you can buy one at Walgreen’s or Wal-Mart), comb\\rthrough your child’s hair in sections removing lice, eggs, and nits. You may\\rneed to clean the comb a few times during this process. You can cover your\\rchild’s hair with the oil, put a shower cap on, and either soak for a few\\rhours, or leave it on overnight. Rinse the hair and comb again. Do this for a\\rcouple of nights. \\nTo clean household items such as pillows, stuffed\\ranimals, rugs, etc., simply put them in a garbage bag, seal it tight, and set\\rthe bag in a closet for about a week. This is sufficient time for any viable\\reggs to hatch, and the young lice to die due to a lack of food source. Make\\rsure to vacuum your house and furniture every day, and wash all bedding and\\rother linens using the hottest water available.\\xa0\\nWe are required to check your child’s hair before they\\rcan return to class. When you’re ready to bring them back, please stop by our\\roffice for us to do this.\\xa0\\nPlease do not hesitate to call your student\\'s school nurse with questions. Further\\rinformation may be found on the Department of State Health Services website (\\nwww.dshs.state.tx.us/schoolhealth\\n) or\\rfrom your physician.\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright © 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

S. Department of Education (USDE) waive specific provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as amended by P.L. 107-110 No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001. The waiver requests that the current Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) calculations and performance targets be replaced with the state’s robust accountability rating system. The new system meets the intent and purposes of the ESEA statute which would allow the state’s existing systems of reform and interventions to guide the support and improvement of teaching and learning.\\nQ: \\nIf the USDE does not approve the waiver request, then how will schools and districts be evaluated for AYP in 2013?\\nA: \\nIf the waiver is approved, the Accountability System Safeguard identifies areas of needed intervention for state and federal purposes. If the waiver is not approved, the commissioner will have to consider other options that will meet federal requirements for 2013. There are ongoing discussions with USDE on the requested waiver but a final decision is still pending\\nTexas 2012 NCLB Report Cards\\nState Report\\nDistrict Report\\nPrimary Campus Report\\nIntermediate Campus Report\\nMiddle School Report\\nTexas 2011 NCLB Report Cards\\nState Report\\nDistrict Report\\nCampus Report\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright © 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

S. Department of Education (USDE) waive specific provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as amended by P.L. 107-110 No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001. The waiver requests that the current Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) calculations and performance targets be replaced with the stateâ\\x80\\x99s robust accountability rating system. The new system meets the intent and purposes of the ESEA statute which would allow the stateâ\\x80\\x99s existing systems of reform and interventions to guide the support and improvement of teaching and learning.\\nQ: \\nIf the USDE does not approve the waiver request, then how will schools and districts be evaluated for AYP in 2013?\\nA: \\nIf the waiver is approved, the Accountability System Safeguard identifies areas of needed intervention for state and federal purposes. If the waiver is not approved, the commissioner will have to consider other options that will meet federal requirements for 2013. There are ongoing discussions with USDE on the requested waiver but a final decision is still pending\\nTexas 2012 NCLB Report Cards\\nState Report\\nDistrict Report\\nPrimary Campus Report\\nIntermediate Campus Report\\nMiddle School Report\\nTexas 2011 NCLB Report Cards\\nState Report\\nDistrict Report\\nCampus Report\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright Â© 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

Arlington Classics Academy is proud to announce that we have achieved the highest academic ratings possible under the stateâ\\x80\\x99s new accountability system. In fact, both Arlington Classics Academy Middle School and Arlington Classics Academy Intermediate received the new top rating of â\\x80\\x9cMet Standardâ\\x80\\x9d and achieved â\\x80\\x9cDistinction Designationâ\\x80\\x9d in Math and Reading.

Charter schools vary in mission and model, serving a wide range of students, many with needs beyond the one-size-fits-all traditional public school. Often, charter schools provide a personalized learning environment that promotes greater student achievement. Although charter schools have some autonomy, they still must meet the rigorous academic standards dictated by the state for all public schools. \\nHow are charter schools funded?\\nCharter Schools receive state funds based on the average daily attendance of students (same as traditional schools); however, they do not receive funds from local tax revenue and the majorities, including Texas charters, do not receive state facilities funding. Texas Education Agency (TEA) data indicated that charter schools receive approximately $1,200* less in total revenue per pupil than traditional public schools. (*Based on TEA Snapshot 2009)\\nCharter Schools in Texas: \\nCharter Schools were authorized by the Texas Legislature in 1995 to provide an alternative to traditional public schools. Currently, Texas has a 215 state cap on charters. In the state of Texas, charter schools operate under and receive academic accountability ratings from the Texas Education Agency. All charter students in Texas take the same Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) test as traditional public school students. \\nWhat is the purpose of charter schools?\\nImprove student learning\\nIncrease the choice of learning opportunities within the public school system\\nCreate professional opportunities that will attract new teachers to the public school system\\nEstablish a new form of accountability for public schools\\nEncourage different and innovative learning meth\\no\\nd\\ns\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright Â© 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

ACA was founded and is guided by parents who sought a better education for their children. Without parental support and involvement, ACA\\'s vision cannot be achieved.\\nWe believe that parents should be involved in their child\\'s education. Each staff member, teacher and parent has a critical role. Ultimately, the school depends upon the family. We welcome and encourage parent participation on every level for the betterment of our students. Volunteers are an important part of the ACA culture. Volunteerism can take on many forms and ACA welcomes them all.\\nThe Parent-Teacher Organization is a vital part of ACA\\'s success. The objectives of the PTO are to support the charter of Arlington Classics Academy, support with the highest priority the high academic goals and achievements, to provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of general education information and to build a sense of community among students, staff and parents. \\xa0 For more information, visit www.acapto.com.\\xa0\\nIt is vital to Arlington Classics Academy that parents of ACA students be involved in campus based and district based decision making, improvement plans, and policy revisions. If you are interested in participating in any committee for an ACA campus or a district-wide committee, please contact the campus principal or the Executive Director of Schools, Craig Sims, at csims@acaedu.net.\\nThe Parent Involvement Policy and guidelines are evaluated annually by the district advisory committee, a committee made up of parents, staff and other ACA stakeholders. \\xa0Below are the most recent and final policies and guidelines related to parental involvement:\\nBoard Policy: Parental Involvement\\xa0\\n(click here)\\nParent-School Compact \\n(click here )\\nParent and Student Expectations\\xa0\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that the Vision of ACA is to be an educational institution of academic excellence that provides a liberal arts curriculum delivered through a classical style of instruction.\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that the Mission of ACA is to equip a diverse student body with a commanding knowledge of western civilization, the origins of liberty, and the ability to sustain that liberty through moral leadership.\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that ACA is a \"school of choice\" designed to provide a rigorous and academically challenging curriculum not typically provided in traditional public schools, with a variety of unique policies and procedures that support its educational mission.\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that enrollment into ACA is evidence of this agreement and the agreement to abide by any and all of ACA\\'s policies, procedures, and expectations.\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that students are required to wear only approved uniforms to school each and every school day.\\xa0\\n\\xa0How can I be involved in my child\\'s education?\\nThere are at least 100 ways you can be involved in your child\\'s education! \\xa0These were adapted from the National Standards for Parent/Family Involvement Programs. We are certain that our wonderful parents can think of many more...\\nGive positive feedback and show appreciation for teachers, staff and administrators.\\xa0\\nApproach interactions with a positive attitude and an open mind.\\nListen to everyone\\'s viewpoint.\\nShare your child\\'s strengths, talents, and interests with your child\\'s teacher.\\nShare expectations and set goals together for your child.\\nMake appointments as needed to discuss your child\\'s progress or any concerns.\\nAttend parent-teacher conferences with specific questions you want to ask.\\nIndicate the best way to give you information (phone, emails, notes, etc)\\nUnderstand and reinforce school rules and expectations at home.\\nParticipate in informal opportunities to talk with and get to know school staff and educators.\\nAddress concerns or questions honestly, openly, and early on.\\nAttend ACA PTO or parent meetings regularly.\\nRead classroom and school newsletters.\\nVisit www.acaedu.net.\\nKnow school staff extensions and office hours.\\nRead and know the student handbook and code of conduct.\\nRequest that information be available in your home language if needed.\\nShare your family\\'s culture and values with your child\\'s school.\\nShare your perceptions with educators and school staff of how parents are treated.\\nWork with school staff and educators to revise and improve the perception of the school climate and culture.\\nMeet your child\\'s friends and get to know their parents.\\nContact your school for information on family programs and resources.\\nHelp establish a parent resource center at the school.\\nAssist in developing parent support programs/groups and attend them.\\nAttend workshops or seminars on various parenting topics.\\nMake donations\\nOffer to volunteer in your child\\'s classrooms, school office, cafeteria, PE classroom, during recess.\\n\\xa0The\\xa0\\nParent and Family Engagement Connection\\xa0\\nFeb. 2018 Newsletter\\xa0(\\nEnglish\\n) (\\nSpanish\\n)\\nApril 2018 Newsletter (\\nEnglish\\n) (\\nSpanish\\n)\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright Â© 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

Parents/guardians of new students must complete a Pre-Admission Form provided at the front desk of the school. An enrollment interview with an Arlington Classics Academy administrator is encouraged before the student starts class. During the interview, academic standards, dress code, attendance policies, and general school operations will be discussed.\\nAn enrollment packet must then be completed and the application process is not be finalized until all forms and required data are obtained. Arlington Classics Academy will review the studentâ\\x80\\x99s discipline history from the last enrolled school, and may exclude the student from admission on this basis. It is the responsibility of the parent to ensure that all forms as listed in the enrollment packet (eg: report card, discipline record) are submitted to the school in a timely manner to be considered for enrollment. Existing students will be required to complete an application/re-enrollment packet, including residency verification, in the spring semester of each year for the following year.\\nThe initial enrollment period for each school year is from February 1 through 6:00 pm on the last school day of February. Siblings of current students and children of employees will be considered first to fill any existing openings, then all other completed Pre-Admission\\nForms submitted during this period will receive equal consideration for admission to ACA. Note: ACA does not guarantee that multiple siblings will be accepted at the same time. It may be necessary that a sibling has to remain on the waiting list until an opening is available for a specific grade level.\\nAfter 6:00 pm on the last school day of February, the Pre-Admission Forms will be sorted by grade and counted. If the number of completed forms for a grade is less than or equal to the number of openings for that grade, all students who have submitted the forms will be offered admission. However, if the number of completed forms for a grade exceeds the number of openings for that grade, there will be a lottery.\\nThe lottery will determine which students are offered admission and the waitlist order for the remaining students. It is the responsibility of the parent to ensure receipt of pre-admission or lottery application forms. Any potential student(s) whose forms are not fully received (completed forms properly submitted to appropriate staff) will forfeit any rights to the lottery and will be added to the end of the appropriate wait list.\\nAny Pre-Admission Forms submitted after the last school day of February will automatically go to the bottom of the waitlist, should a waitlist exist for that grade. When there has been a change in residency, it is the responsibility of the parents to notify the campus administration immediately.\\xa0\\nNo person shall be excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination, harassment or retaliation in any ARLINGTON CLASSICS ACADEMY\\xa0program\\xa0on the basis of age; race, color, or national origin; sex, gender, or gender identity; or disability, or relationship or association with an individual with a disability; or any other basis protected by law.\\xa0\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright Â© 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

Parents/guardians of new students must complete a Pre-Admission Form provided at the front desk of the school. An enrollment interview with an Arlington Classics Academy administrator is encouraged before the student starts class. During the interview, academic standards, dress code, attendance policies, and general school operations will be discussed.\\nAn enrollment packet must then be completed and the application process is not be finalized until all forms and required data are obtained. Arlington Classics Academy will review the studentâ\\x80\\x99s discipline history from the last enrolled school, and may exclude the student from admission on this basis. It is the responsibility of the parent to ensure that all forms as listed in the enrollment packet (eg: report card, discipline record) are submitted to the school in a timely manner to be considered for enrollment. Existing students will be required to complete an application/re-enrollment packet, including residency verification, in the spring semester of each year for the following year.\\nThe initial enrollment period for each school year is from February 1 through 6:00 pm on the last school day of February. Siblings of current students and children of employees will be considered first to fill any existing openings, then all other completed Pre-Admission\\nForms submitted during this period will receive equal consideration for admission to ACA. Note: ACA does not guarantee that multiple siblings will be accepted at the same time. It may be necessary that a sibling has to remain on the waiting list until an opening is available for a specific grade level.\\nAfter 6:00 pm on the last school day of February, the Pre-Admission Forms will be sorted by grade and counted. If the number of completed forms for a grade is less than or equal to the number of openings for that grade, all students who have submitted the forms will be offered admission. However, if the number of completed forms for a grade exceeds the number of openings for that grade, there will be a lottery.\\nThe lottery will determine which students are offered admission and the waitlist order for the remaining students. It is the responsibility of the parent to ensure receipt of pre-admission or lottery application forms. Any potential student(s) whose forms are not fully received (completed forms properly submitted to appropriate staff) will forfeit any rights to the lottery and will be added to the end of the appropriate wait list.\\nAny Pre-Admission Forms submitted after the last school day of February will automatically go to the bottom of the waitlist, should a waitlist exist for that grade. When there has been a change in residency, it is the responsibility of the parents to notify the campus administration immediately.\\xa0\\nNo person shall be excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination, harassment or retaliation in any ARLINGTON CLASSICS ACADEMY\\xa0program\\xa0on the basis of age; race, color, or national origin; sex, gender, or gender identity; or disability, or relationship or association with an individual with a disability; or any other basis protected by law.\\xa0\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright Â© 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

One scene will establish the \"normal\" behavior of one character that, at some point in the performance, finds itself among others who react to the out-of-place behavior. The other character\\'s behavior will stand out too, but this character will end up in a setting where its odd behavior is considered normal. The performance will also include a meter that indicates the degree of odd/normal behavior and a creative scene change.\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright Â© 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

ACA was founded and is guided by parents who sought a better education for their children. Without parental support and involvement, ACA\\'s vision cannot be achieved.\\nWe believe that parents should be involved in their child\\'s education. Each staff member, teacher and parent has a critical role. Ultimately, the school depends upon the family. We welcome and encourage parent participation on every level for the betterment of our students. Volunteers are an important part of the ACA culture. Volunteerism can take on many forms and ACA welcomes them all.\\nThe Parent-Teacher Organization is a vital part of ACA\\'s success. The objectives of the PTO are to support the charter of Arlington Classics Academy, support with the highest priority the high academic goals and achievements, to provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of general education information and to build a sense of community among students, staff and parents. \\xa0 For more information, visit www.acapto.com.\\xa0\\nIt is vital to Arlington Classics Academy that parents of ACA students be involved in campus based and district based decision making, improvement plans, and policy revisions. If you are interested in participating in any committee for an ACA campus or a district-wide committee, please contact the campus principal or the Executive Director of Schools, Craig Sims, at csims@acaedu.net.\\nThe Parent Involvement Policy and guidelines are evaluated annually by the district advisory committee, a committee made up of parents, staff and other ACA stakeholders. \\xa0Below are the most recent and final policies and guidelines related to parental involvement:\\nBoard Policy: Parental Involvement\\xa0\\n(click here)\\nParent-School Compact \\n(click here )\\nParent and Student Expectations\\xa0\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that the Vision of ACA is to be an educational institution of academic excellence that provides a liberal arts curriculum delivered through a classical style of instruction.\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that the Mission of ACA is to equip a diverse student body with a commanding knowledge of western civilization, the origins of liberty, and the ability to sustain that liberty through moral leadership.\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that ACA is a \"school of choice\" designed to provide a rigorous and academically challenging curriculum not typically provided in traditional public schools, with a variety of unique policies and procedures that support its educational mission.\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that enrollment into ACA is evidence of this agreement and the agreement to abide by any and all of ACA\\'s policies, procedures, and expectations.\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that students are required to wear only approved uniforms to school each and every school day.\\xa0\\n\\xa0How can I be involved in my child\\'s education?\\nThere are at least 100 ways you can be involved in your child\\'s education! \\xa0These were adapted from the National Standards for Parent/Family Involvement Programs. We are certain that our wonderful parents can think of many more...\\nGive positive feedback and show appreciation for teachers, staff and administrators.\\xa0\\nApproach interactions with a positive attitude and an open mind.\\nListen to everyone\\'s viewpoint.\\nShare your child\\'s strengths, talents, and interests with your child\\'s teacher.\\nShare expectations and set goals together for your child.\\nMake appointments as needed to discuss your child\\'s progress or any concerns.\\nAttend parent-teacher conferences with specific questions you want to ask.\\nIndicate the best way to give you information (phone, emails, notes, etc)\\nUnderstand and reinforce school rules and expectations at home.\\nParticipate in informal opportunities to talk with and get to know school staff and educators.\\nAddress concerns or questions honestly, openly, and early on.\\nAttend ACA PTO or parent meetings regularly.\\nRead classroom and school newsletters.\\nVisit www.acaedu.net.\\nKnow school staff extensions and office hours.\\nRead and know the student handbook and code of conduct.\\nRequest that information be available in your home language if needed.\\nShare your family\\'s culture and values with your child\\'s school.\\nShare your perceptions with educators and school staff of how parents are treated.\\nWork with school staff and educators to revise and improve the perception of the school climate and culture.\\nMeet your child\\'s friends and get to know their parents.\\nContact your school for information on family programs and resources.\\nHelp establish a parent resource center at the school.\\nAssist in developing parent support programs/groups and attend them.\\nAttend workshops or seminars on various parenting topics.\\nMake donations\\nOffer to volunteer in your child\\'s classrooms, school office, cafeteria, PE classroom, during recess.\\n\\xa0The\\xa0\\nParent and Family Engagement Connection\\xa0\\nFeb. 2018 Newsletter\\xa0(\\nEnglish\\n) (\\nSpanish\\n)\\nApril 2018 Newsletter (\\nEnglish\\n) (\\nSpanish\\n)\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright Â© 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

ACA was founded and is guided by parents who sought a better education for their children. Without parental support and involvement, ACA\\'s vision cannot be achieved.\\nWe believe that parents should be involved in their child\\'s education. Each staff member, teacher and parent has a critical role. Ultimately, the school depends upon the family. We welcome and encourage parent participation on every level for the betterment of our students. Volunteers are an important part of the ACA culture. Volunteerism can take on many forms and ACA welcomes them all.\\nThe Parent-Teacher Organization is a vital part of ACA\\'s success. The objectives of the PTO are to support the charter of Arlington Classics Academy, support with the highest priority the high academic goals and achievements, to provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of general education information and to build a sense of community among students, staff and parents. \\xa0 For more information, visit www.acapto.com.\\xa0\\nIt is vital to Arlington Classics Academy that parents of ACA students be involved in campus based and district based decision making, improvement plans, and policy revisions. If you are interested in participating in any committee for an ACA campus or a district-wide committee, please contact the campus principal or the Executive Director of Schools, Craig Sims, at csims@acaedu.net.\\nThe Parent Involvement Policy and guidelines are evaluated annually by the district advisory committee, a committee made up of parents, staff and other ACA stakeholders. \\xa0Below are the most recent and final policies and guidelines related to parental involvement:\\nBoard Policy: Parental Involvement\\xa0\\n(click here)\\nParent-School Compact \\n(click here )\\nParent and Student Expectations\\xa0\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that the Vision of ACA is to be an educational institution of academic excellence that provides a liberal arts curriculum delivered through a classical style of instruction.\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that the Mission of ACA is to equip a diverse student body with a commanding knowledge of western civilization, the origins of liberty, and the ability to sustain that liberty through moral leadership.\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that ACA is a \"school of choice\" designed to provide a rigorous and academically challenging curriculum not typically provided in traditional public schools, with a variety of unique policies and procedures that support its educational mission.\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that enrollment into ACA is evidence of this agreement and the agreement to abide by any and all of ACA\\'s policies, procedures, and expectations.\\n\\xa0Parents and students understand and agree that students are required to wear only approved uniforms to school each and every school day.\\xa0\\n\\xa0How can I be involved in my child\\'s education?\\nThere are at least 100 ways you can be involved in your child\\'s education! \\xa0These were adapted from the National Standards for Parent/Family Involvement Programs. We are certain that our wonderful parents can think of many more...\\nGive positive feedback and show appreciation for teachers, staff and administrators.\\xa0\\nApproach interactions with a positive attitude and an open mind.\\nListen to everyone\\'s viewpoint.\\nShare your child\\'s strengths, talents, and interests with your child\\'s teacher.\\nShare expectations and set goals together for your child.\\nMake appointments as needed to discuss your child\\'s progress or any concerns.\\nAttend parent-teacher conferences with specific questions you want to ask.\\nIndicate the best way to give you information (phone, emails, notes, etc)\\nUnderstand and reinforce school rules and expectations at home.\\nParticipate in informal opportunities to talk with and get to know school staff and educators.\\nAddress concerns or questions honestly, openly, and early on.\\nAttend ACA PTO or parent meetings regularly.\\nRead classroom and school newsletters.\\nVisit www.acaedu.net.\\nKnow school staff extensions and office hours.\\nRead and know the student handbook and code of conduct.\\nRequest that information be available in your home language if needed.\\nShare your family\\'s culture and values with your child\\'s school.\\nShare your perceptions with educators and school staff of how parents are treated.\\nWork with school staff and educators to revise and improve the perception of the school climate and culture.\\nMeet your child\\'s friends and get to know their parents.\\nContact your school for information on family programs and resources.\\nHelp establish a parent resource center at the school.\\nAssist in developing parent support programs/groups and attend them.\\nAttend workshops or seminars on various parenting topics.\\nMake donations\\nOffer to volunteer in your child\\'s classrooms, school office, cafeteria, PE classroom, during recess.\\n\\xa0The\\xa0\\nParent and Family Engagement Connection\\xa0\\nFeb. 2018 Newsletter\\xa0(\\nEnglish\\n) (\\nSpanish\\n)\\nApril 2018 Newsletter (\\nEnglish\\n) (\\nSpanish\\n)\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright Â© 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

This school year, your monthly menu will focus on a Texas grown product. Each month we will choose an item to learn more about and that item will also be featured on the menu that month. Be sure to try menu items which are TEXAS GROWN! \\nTEXAS: \\nSpinach is thought to have originated in ancient Persia in todayâ\\x80\\x99s Iran. It made its way to China in the 7\\nth \\ncentury. Spinach was recorded in Europe as early as the mid-13\\nth \\ncentury and colonists brought spinach seed with them to the New World. \\nTexas is number three in the United States in spinach production and provides about 30% of all spinach in the United States. Spinach is grown in several regions in Texas including the Winter Garden region (Southwest of San Antonio), the Lower Rio Grande Valley (McAllen-Harlingen) and the Pan Handle (Lubbock). Spinach is a very hardy crop and thrives in cool, moist conditions. Although spinach is readily available through-out the year, its primary growing season is March through May and September through October. \\nFOOD OF THE MONTH: SPINACH \\nSpinach is a \"super-food\" with nearly twice as much protein, calcium, iron, potassium, Vitamin A, Vitamin B and B2, niacin and Vitamin C as most other leafy greens. Spinach is also very high in Vitamin K which is important for bone health. Calorie for calorie, leafy green vegetables like spinach provide more nutrients than many other foods. \\nOverview of the USDA Smart Snacks Rule\\nChild Nutrition Policy from Texas Department of Agriculture\\nPolicy Brochure from TDA\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright Â© 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

Charter schools vary in mission and model, serving a wide range of students, many with needs beyond the one-size-fits-all traditional public school. Often, charter schools provide a personalized learning environment that promotes greater student achievement. Although charter schools have some autonomy, they still must meet the rigorous academic standards dictated by the state for all public schools. \\nHow are charter schools funded?\\nCharter Schools receive state funds based on the average daily attendance of students (same as traditional schools); however, they do not receive funds from local tax revenue and the majorities, including Texas charters, do not receive state facilities funding. Texas Education Agency (TEA) data indicated that charter schools receive approximately $1,200* less in total revenue per pupil than traditional public schools. (*Based on TEA Snapshot 2009)\\nCharter Schools in Texas: \\nCharter Schools were authorized by the Texas Legislature in 1995 to provide an alternative to traditional public schools. Currently, Texas has a 215 state cap on charters. In the state of Texas, charter schools operate under and receive academic accountability ratings from the Texas Education Agency. All charter students in Texas take the same Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) test as traditional public school students. \\nWhat is the purpose of charter schools?\\nImprove student learning\\nIncrease the choice of learning opportunities within the public school system\\nCreate professional opportunities that will attract new teachers to the public school system\\nEstablish a new form of accountability for public schools\\nEncourage different and innovative learning meth\\no\\nd\\ns\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright Â© 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

S. Department of Education (USDE) waive specific provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as amended by P.L. 107-110 No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001. The waiver requests that the current Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) calculations and performance targets be replaced with the stateâ\\x80\\x99s robust accountability rating system. The new system meets the intent and purposes of the ESEA statute which would allow the stateâ\\x80\\x99s existing systems of reform and interventions to guide the support and improvement of teaching and learning.\\nQ: \\nIf the USDE does not approve the waiver request, then how will schools and districts be evaluated for AYP in 2013?\\nA: \\nIf the waiver is approved, the Accountability System Safeguard identifies areas of needed intervention for state and federal purposes. If the waiver is not approved, the commissioner will have to consider other options that will meet federal requirements for 2013. There are ongoing discussions with USDE on the requested waiver but a final decision is still pending\\nTexas 2012 NCLB Report Cards\\nState Report\\nDistrict Report\\nPrimary Campus Report\\nIntermediate Campus Report\\nMiddle School Report\\nTexas 2011 NCLB Report Cards\\nState Report\\nDistrict Report\\nCampus Report\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright Â© 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

They are about 2-3 mm long. They are\\rfound in the hair near the scalp and can cause intense itching and skin\\rirritation by biting the scalp. Lice will leave eggs on the hair mostly behind\\rthe ears and at the nape of the neck. These eggs are small spots that are glued\\ron the hair close to the scalp, and are difficult to see and remove. Eggs will\\rhatch every 7-12 days, and the young lice will reach full maturity 9-12 days\\rafter hatching. Hatched eggs, or nits, can be seen as small white spots on the\\rhair strands, and are usually farther away from the scalp as viable eggs are.\\rLice can survive for only less than 24 hours without a food source (i.e. a\\rhuman head).\\xa0\\r\\r\\nThere are some common misconceptions about lice. For\\rinstance, head lice do not hop, jump, or fly; they crawl, and prefer to be on\\rsomeoneâ\\x80\\x99s head. They move from child to child through head to head contact, or\\rvery rarely by sharing items such as combs, hair brushes, pillows, or hats;\\rmost lice or eggs on brushes or combs have been found to be injured or damaged,\\rand unviable. Lice do not carry or spread any diseases. Additionally, hair\\rlength has been found to have no effect on lice infestations.\\xa0\\nAlthough there is currently no Texas statute regulating\\rpediculosis, we require any student with evidence of live lice to be sent home\\rand treated. If only nits are found, the school nurse will communicate with the\\rparent, and the decision to remove the student from class will be left at the\\rparentâ\\x80\\x99s discretion.\\xa0Please do not preventatively treat your child. Some of the treatments\\r(i.e. Rid, Nix, etc.), if used incorrectly, or more than recommended, can be\\rharmful to your child. Treat only if you find lice or eggs. If\\ryou find that your student is affected, check the rest of your household, and\\rtreat all members who are affected.\\xa0\\nTo detect lice, separate the hair in sections and look\\rclosely for either live bugs, or eggs on the hair. Eggs or nits close to the\\rscalp can be indicative of an active case. If the nits are further out in the\\rstrands, it is possible that the case has diminished, but will still need to be\\rtreated. To distinguish eggs and nits from dandruff, rub a finger over the\\rarea. If the spot moves, it is dandruff. Please do not feel that your, or any\\rother child, is â\\x80\\x9cdirty,â\\x80\\x9d if he/she has lice; they prefer clean hair because it\\rallows them to better hold on to the hair shafts.\\xa0\\nWe DO NOT recommend using the\\raforementioned treatments, or anything as extreme as pet insect killers like\\rAdvantage. However, if you choose to use those treatments, please be sure to\\ruse them sparingly and exactly as directed on the packaging. There are natural\\rtreatments available, such as hot oil, olive, tea tree, or peppermint oils.\\rWash your childâ\\x80\\x99s hair with hot water (but not hot enough to burn). With a\\rfine-toothed lice comb (you can buy one at Walgreenâ\\x80\\x99s or Wal-Mart), comb\\rthrough your childâ\\x80\\x99s hair in sections removing lice, eggs, and nits. You may\\rneed to clean the comb a few times during this process. You can cover your\\rchildâ\\x80\\x99s hair with the oil, put a shower cap on, and either soak for a few\\rhours, or leave it on overnight. Rinse the hair and comb again. Do this for a\\rcouple of nights. \\nTo clean household items such as pillows, stuffed\\ranimals, rugs, etc., simply put them in a garbage bag, seal it tight, and set\\rthe bag in a closet for about a week. This is sufficient time for any viable\\reggs to hatch, and the young lice to die due to a lack of food source. Make\\rsure to vacuum your house and furniture every day, and wash all bedding and\\rother linens using the hottest water available.\\xa0\\nWe are required to check your childâ\\x80\\x99s hair before they\\rcan return to class. When youâ\\x80\\x99re ready to bring them back, please stop by our\\roffice for us to do this.\\xa0\\nPlease do not hesitate to call your student\\'s school nurse with questions. Further\\rinformation may be found on the Department of State Health Services website (\\nwww.dshs.state.tx.us/schoolhealth\\n) or\\rfrom your physician.\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright Â© 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

My name is Robyn Steward and I love teaching Art! As an art educator, I pledge to use a variety of teaching tools, strategies and continuous professional development in order to make my classroom as enlightening to my students as possible. My idea of success stems from acting as a guide and/or coach so that my students meet their full potential not only in developing higher level thinking skills but in celebrating cultural, imaginative and individual diversities in a constructive way through art. One of my main goals is that your child will love and appreciate the visual arts as much as I do.\\nOutside of school, I am married to my best friend, Doug Steward. He is also an educator. We are now â\\x80\\x9cempty nestersâ\\x80\\x9d of five children. Four beautiful girls and one son. I also have one beautiful granddaughter that is the joy of my life. Outside my family and work, there is only one thing that is most important and that is my personal relationship with my Father and Lord. Without Him, nothing is possible!\\nLastly, thank you for sharing your child with me this year. I look forward to a very productive and successful school year. If you should have any questions, please feel free to contact me at\\xa0\\nrsteward@acaedu.net\\n\\xa0or you may reach me at school, 817.303.1553\\nThank you for your cooperation,\\nMrs. Steward\\n2800B W.

He has a B.S. in both biology and math from UT at Arlington. Cliff was chosen Teacher of the Year (Intermediate Grade) at ACA during the 2007-2008 school year.\\xa0 He was one of the founding members of the Dads Club at ACA. In 2011, he was awarded the Classic Moments Award. This is an award given in honor of actions that exemplify the spirit, mission and values of Arlington Classics Academy.\\xa0 One of the major reasons that Cliff enjoys teaching at ACA is because students are eager to learn. Also, ACA has parents who are very involved and highly supportive.\\nSome of his hobbies include reading, clipping comics & articles, coin collecting and observing nature, especially insects, thus his nickname â\\x80\\x9cBugBoyâ\\x80\\x9d. Cliff has been married to his wife, Karen, for\\xa021 years and has two daughters who have attended ACA, Katie, who is now in 12th grade and Carly who is in 10th grade. So, Cliff has been an ACA parent as well!\\nI am looking forward to being on 4B again, with three wonderful team teachers, fantastic specials teachers and a great staff. Letâ\\x80\\x99s not forget the super 4th-grade students and families.\\n2800B W.

It\\'s hard to believe, but this will be my 28th year in education. \\xa0I began my career as a first grade teacher, then later went on to become a school guidance counselor, working at the elementary and junior high level, and have spent the past 11 years as an elementary administrator. \\xa0\\nI grew up in a small town and my roots are simple...faith, family, and serving others before yourself.\\xa0 My husband & I live in Arlington and we have two children.\\xa0 Our oldest, Haven is a Freshman at Southern Nazarene University in Bethany, Oklahoma where she plays volleyball and is majoring in nursing, and our youngest, Holden is a Freshman at Grace Prep Academy.\\xa0\\xa0We love to travel any chance we can get, but when we\\'re home, we\\'re usually in a gym or on a field cheering on our kid\\'s sporting events, or serving at our local church home. \\xa0\\nI firmly believe that everything must first be relational before it\\'s functional, so I am very intentional about building relationships, being available & transparent, and doing what\\'s best for kids at all times.\\xa0 Thank you for partnering with ACA and helping your child be the best they can.\\xa0 I look forward to\\xa0getting to know you and your family better & making \"Griffin memories\" along the way\\n. \\xa0\\nMrs. Teri Rodgers\\xa0\\n\\xa0Haleakala Crater\\n(Sunset on Maui Volcano, 2016)\\n2800B W.

Charter schools vary in mission and model, serving a wide range of students, many with needs beyond the one-size-fits-all traditional public school. Often, charter schools provide a personalized learning environment that promotes greater student achievement. Although charter schools have some autonomy, they still must meet the rigorous academic standards dictated by the state for all public schools. \\nHow are charter schools funded?\\nCharter Schools receive state funds based on the average daily attendance of students (same as traditional schools); however, they do not receive funds from local tax revenue and the majorities, including Texas charters, do not receive state facilities funding. Texas Education Agency (TEA) data indicated that charter schools receive approximately $1,200* less in total revenue per pupil than traditional public schools. (*Based on TEA Snapshot 2009)\\nCharter Schools in Texas: \\nCharter Schools were authorized by the Texas Legislature in 1995 to provide an alternative to traditional public schools. Currently, Texas has a 215 state cap on charters. In the state of Texas, charter schools operate under and receive academic accountability ratings from the Texas Education Agency. All charter students in Texas take the same Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) test as traditional public school students. \\nWhat is the purpose of charter schools?\\nImprove student learning\\nIncrease the choice of learning opportunities within the public school system\\nCreate professional opportunities that will attract new teachers to the public school system\\nEstablish a new form of accountability for public schools\\nEncourage different and innovative learning meth\\no\\nd\\ns\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright Â© 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

S. Department of Education (USDE) waive specific provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as amended by P.L. 107-110 No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001. The waiver requests that the current Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) calculations and performance targets be replaced with the stateâ\\x80\\x99s robust accountability rating system. The new system meets the intent and purposes of the ESEA statute which would allow the stateâ\\x80\\x99s existing systems of reform and interventions to guide the support and improvement of teaching and learning.\\nQ: \\nIf the USDE does not approve the waiver request, then how will schools and districts be evaluated for AYP in 2013?\\nA: \\nIf the waiver is approved, the Accountability System Safeguard identifies areas of needed intervention for state and federal purposes. If the waiver is not approved, the commissioner will have to consider other options that will meet federal requirements for 2013. There are ongoing discussions with USDE on the requested waiver but a final decision is still pending\\nTexas 2012 NCLB Report Cards\\nState Report\\nDistrict Report\\nPrimary Campus Report\\nIntermediate Campus Report\\nMiddle School Report\\nTexas 2011 NCLB Report Cards\\nState Report\\nDistrict Report\\nCampus Report\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright Â© 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

Tests for mathematics and reading are available for grades K-8 and science and language usage are available for grades 2-8. \\xa0These tests yield a national percentile score as well as a growth scale score (RIT).\\xa0 ACA can administer MAP in the fall, winter, and spring, though which tests are given at which times are largely campus decisions.\\nThe MAP RIT Scale (\\n2015 Norms\\n)\\nThe RIT Scale is a curriculum scale that uses individual item difficulty values to estimate student achievement. An advantage of the RIT scale is that it can relate the numbers on the scale directly to the difficulty of items on the tests. In addition, the RIT scale is an equal interval scale. Equal interval means that the difference between scores is the same regardless of whether a student is at the top, bottom, or middle of the RIT scale, and it has the same meaning regardless of grade level. RIT scales, like scales underlying most educational tests, are built from data about the performance of individual examinees on individual items.\\nMAP tests produce scores that make it possible to monitor student growth from year to year along developmental curriculum scales. The RIT Charts show examples of the kinds of work students can do at various points along the NWEA RIT scale, assuming they have been exposed to the content. This type of information is helpful in supporting appropriate instruction. \\xa0All MAP tests are based on the state curriculum for Texas (TEKS - Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills).\\nFAQs\\nWhere can I learn more about NWEA MAP?\\nYou can visit their website at\\n\\xa0https://www.nwea.org/assessments/map/\\n.\\nWhat resources are available to me as a parent?\\xa0\\nA Parent\\'s Guide to MAP\\nA Parent\\'s Guide To MAP (Spanish)\\nRIT Reference Chart - MPG\\nRIT Reference Chart - MAP\\nTo use the RIT Reference Charts, find the range that contains your child\\'s RIT score for the appropriate grade and test. \\xa0The RIT Reference Charts (MPG for Primary, MAP for Intermediate and Middle School) show an example item that your student is working on at each RIT range. \\xa0\\nFor the RIT Reference Chart, the range in which the RIT score falls is the current instructional level. \\xa0Items below that RIT range are assumed to have been already learned and items above the RIT range are new topics to be introduced.\\nThere is also a wonderful resource page put together by a district in Wisconsin that gives links to online practice resources by RIT score and goal strand.\\nMath by RIT score\\nMath by Goal Strand\\xa0\\nReading by RIT score\\xa0\\nReading by Goal Strand\\xa0\\nWhat happened to the ITBS (Iowa Test of Basic Skills)?\\xa0\\nACA elected to replace the yearly testing of students with ITBS with the NWEA MAP for three main reasons. \\xa0First, the ITBS could only be given once a year. \\xa0The information gained from the test garnered a wealth of information about what students did or did not know but its infrequency did not make it useful in impacting instruction. \\xa0On the other hand, NWEA MAP can be given up to three times a year and this frequency will help us track student growth and make adjustments to our instruction during the school year. \\xa0Second, ITBS was aligned to Common Core State Standards and was testing our students on a curriculum that we don\\'t teach. \\xa0NWEA MAP though is aligned to our state TEKS so we are assessing what we are teaching. \\xa0Finally, the ITBS was a static test that asked the same questions year after year. \\xa0If the test was too easy for some students, it had a hard ceiling past which we could not track their level of understanding. \\xa0The NWEA MAP is a computer-based adaptive test. \\xa0What that means is that test items are drawn from an item bank and the difficulty of the questions changes based on how successful the students are being. \\xa0As a student answers the questions correctly, the \\nitems become increasingly challenging until the instructional level of the child has been determined.\\nIs the MAP assessment a norm-referenced\\xa0assessment?\\xa0\\xa0\\nYes, the MAP assessment is nationally normed every 3 or 4 years (most recently in 2015). \\xa0This allows for comparison of student scores to the \"average\" scores of other students in the same grade from a wide variety of school across the country. \\xa0This will help serve as a starting point for teachers to review data and gain a better of a child\\'s current instructional level.\\nHow will ACA use the RIT scores my child received on the MAP assessments?\\nMAP scores help teachers and administrators determine the current instructional level of each student. \\xa0In knowing this, lessons can be designed that provide for students at all levels within the same classroom setting. \\xa0By knowing where every student stand in each objective area, teachers are better equipped with tools that allow them to design flexible groups and differentiated lessons to meet each student where they are on the learning continuum and help move them forward. \\xa0With this data, teacher can support struggling learners, more accurately plan on-grade-level instruction, and enrich students who are moving faster than others. \\xa0With several assessments taken throughout the year, teachers now have a nationally-normed objective test with which to track individual student progress and interpret strengths and weaknesses.\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright Â© 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

D. Hirsch, Jr., author of The Schools We Need, and is based on a large body of research in cognitive psychology, as well as a careful examination of several of the world\\'s fairest and most effective school systems.\\nDr. Hirsch has argued that, for the sake of academic excellence, greater fairness, and higher literacy, early schooling should provide a solid, specific, shared core curriculum in order to help children establish strong foundations of knowledge. After wide consultation, the content of this core curriculum has been outlined in two books -- the \\nCore Knowledge Preschool Sequence and the \\nCore Knowledge Sequence, K-8-- that state explicitly what students should learn at each grade level. Currently, hundreds of schools and thousands of dedicated educators are participating in this school reform movement throughout the United States.\\nResources for Understanding the Core Knowledge Curriculum:\\nThe Core Knowledge Sequence: Content guidelines for Grades K-8: A comprehensive topic guide to the curriculum.\\nThe Core Knowledge Grader Series: \\nWhat Your Kindergartner - Sixth Grader Needs to Know\\n(click on book to be taken to the Core Knowledge Bookstore website)\\nBooks to Build On: A Grade-by-Grade Guide for Parents and Teachers\\n - An annotated list of books that compliment the Core Knowledge curriculum.

The early years of school are spent in absorbing facts, systematically laying the foundations for advanced study. In the middle grades, students learn to think through arguments. In the high school years, they learn to express themselves. This classical pattern is called the trivium.\\nThe first years of schooling are called the \"grammar stage\" -- not because you spend four years doing English, but because these are the years in which the building blocks for all other learning are laid, just as grammar is the foundation for language. In the elementary school years -- what we commonly think of as grades one through four -- the mind is ready to absorb information. Children at this age actually find memorization fun. So during this period, education involves not self-expression and self-discovery, but rather the learning of facts. Rules of phonics and spelling, rules of grammar, poems, the vocabulary of foreign languages, the stories of history and literature, descriptions of plants and animals and the human body, the facts of mathematics -- the list goes on. This information makes up the \"grammar,\" or the basic building blocks, for the second stage of education.\\nBy fifth grade, a child\\'s mind begins to think more analytically. Middle-school students are less interested in finding out facts than in asking \"Why?\" The second phase of the classical education, the \"Logic Stage,\" is a time when the child begins to pay attention to cause and effect, to the relationships between different fields of knowledge relate, to the way facts fit together into a logical framework.\\nA student is ready for the Logic Stage when the capacity for abstract thought begins to mature. During these years, the student begins algebra and the study of logic, and begins to apply logic to all academic subjects. The logic of writing, for example, includes paragraph construction and learning to support a thesis; the logic of reading involves the criticism and analysis of texts, not simple absorption of information; the logic of history demands that the student find out why the War of 1812 was fought, rather than simply reading its story; the logic of science requires that the child learn the scientific method.\\nThe final phase of a classical education, the \"Rhetoric Stage,\" builds on the first two. At this point, the high school student learns to write and speak with force and originality. The student of rhetoric applies the rules of logic learned in middle school to the foundational information learned in the early grades and expresses his conclusions in clear, forceful, elegant language. Students also begin to specialize in whatever branch of knowledge attracts them; these are the years for art camps, college courses, foreign travel, apprenticeships, and other forms of specialized training.\\nA classical education is more than simply a pattern of learning, though. Classical education is language-focused; learning is accomplished through words, written and spoken, rather than through images (pictures, videos, and television).\\nWhy is this important? Language-learning and image-learning require very different habits of thought. Language requires the mind to work harder; in reading, the brain is forced to translate a symbol (words on the page) into a concept. Images, such as those on videos and television, allow the mind to be passive. In front of a video screen, the brain can \"sit back\" and relax; faced with the written page, the mind is required to roll its sleeves up and get back to work.\\nA classical education, then, has two important aspects. It is language-focused. And it follows a specific three-part pattern: the mind must be first supplied with facts and images, then given the logical tools for organization of facts, and finally equipped to express conclusions.\\nBut that isn\\'t all. To the classical mind, all knowledge is interrelated. Astronomy (for example) isn\\'t studied in isolation; it\\'s learned along with the history of scientific discovery, which leads into the church\\'s relationship to science and from there to the intricacies of medieval church history. The reading of the Odyssey leads the student into the consideration of Greek history, the nature of heroism, the development of the epic, and man\\'s understanding of the divine.\\nThis is easier said than done. The world is full of knowledge, and finding the links between fields of study can be a mind-twisting task. A classical education meets this challenge by taking history as its organizing outline -- beginning with the ancients and progressing forward to the moderns in history, science, literature, art and music.\\nWe suggest that the twelve years of education consist of three repetitions of the same four-year pattern: Ancients, Middle Ages, Renaissance and Reformation, and Modern Times. The child studies these four time periods at varying levels -- simple for grades 1-4, more difficult in grades 5-8 (when the student begins to read original sources), and taking an even more complex approach in grades 9-12, when the student works through these time periods using original sources (from Homer to Hitler) and also has the opportunity to pursue a particular interest (music, dance, technology, medicine, biology, creative writing) in depth.\\nThe other subject areas of the curriculum are linked to history studies. The student who is working on ancient history will read Greek and Roman mythology, the tales of the Iliad and Odyssey, early medievial writings, Chinese and Japanese fairy tales, and (for the older student) the classical texts of Plato, Herodutus, Virgil, Aristotle. She\\'ll read Beowulf, Dante, Chaucer, Shakespeare the following year, when she\\'s studying medieval and early Renaissance history. When the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries are studied, she starts with Swift (Gulliver\\'s Travels) and ends with Dickens; finally, she reads modern literature as she is studying modern history.\\nThe sciences are studied in a four-year pattern that roughly corresponds to the periods of scientific discovery: biology, classification and the human body (subjects known to the ancients); earth science and basic astronomy (which flowered during the early Renaissance); chemistry (which came into its own during the early modern period); and then basic physics and computer science (very modern subjects).\\nThis pattern lends coherence to the study of history, science, and literature -- subjects that are too often fragmented and confusing. The pattern widens and deepens as the student progresses in maturity and learning. For example, a first grader listens to you read the story of the Iliad from one of the picture book versions available at any public library. Four years later, the fifth grader reads one of the popular middle-grade adaptations -- Olivia Coolidge\\'s The Trojan War, or Roger Lancelyn Greene\\'s Tales of Troy. Four more years go by, and the ninth grader -- faced with the Iliad itself -- plunges right in, undaunted.\\nThe classical education is, above all, systematic -- in direct contrast to the scattered, unorganized nature of so much secondary education. This systematic, rigorous study has two purposes.\\nRigorous study develops virtue in the student. Aristotle defined virtue as the ability to act in accordance to what one knows to be right. The virtuous man (or woman) can force himself to do what he knows to be right, even when it runs against his inclinations. The classical education continually asks a student to work against his baser inclinations (laziness, or the desire to watch another half hour of TV) in order to reach a goal -- mastery of a subject.\\nSystematic study also allows the student to join what Mortimer Adler calls the \"Great Conversation\" -- the ongoing conversation of great minds down through the ages. Much modern education is so eclectic that the student has little opportunity to make connections between past events and the flood of current information. \"The beauty of the classical curriculum,\" writes classical schoolmaster David Hicks, \"is that it dwells on one problem, one author, or one epoch long enough to allow even the youngest student a chance to exercise his mind in a scholarly way: to make connections and to trace developments, lines of reasoning, patterns of action, recurring symbolisms, plots, and motifs.\"\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright Â© 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.

There are three fundamental keys to accomplishing this:\\nStaff Development We hire dedicated, hard-working, creative teachers and staff who understand the effort required to fulfill our mission. We encourage teachers to look for new and better ways to teach. Our teachers are committed to the principles of childhood development, multiple intelligences, and learner readiness to ensure the academic success of the child. The ACA teacher will be committed to being life-long learners themselves, particularly with regard to learning new strategies for aiding student understanding and mastery of the subject content.\\nCurriculum Development\\nWe are required by the Texas Education Agency (TEA) to teach the TEKS curriculum that is taught in all public schools in the state. However, our curriculum is not limited to the minimum requirements. The schoolâ\\x80\\x99s educational goal is to develop students who are fully armed with all the tools western civilization offers. These tools include a clear understanding of American culture and those that preceded it. We believe that the western world is foremost responsible for handing down the basis for our culture, our liberty, and our social customs. Our culture has grown from the heritage of the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans to its current state.\\nThe CK curriculum addresses these integral educational goals and is paramount to ACAâ\\x80\\x99s enriched curriculum. Along with the knowledge of our past and present, ACA will strive to ensure that its students understand the development and importance of our civil rights and freedoms in the maintenance of our society. Students will be taught the importance of individual actions â\\x80\\x93 that one person can and should make a difference in our world. By the study of world leaders, this fundamental truth will be taught so that students will understand that their own daily habits, actions, and personal philosophy affect the immediate environment, and ultimately the world in which they live.\\nThe ACA curriculum incorporates a structured grammar program that provides a foundation for even the youngest of our students. ACA believes in a strong phonics based program but does recognize the need for a balanced literacy approach to helping students learn to read at the earliest possible age. All language arts curriculum taught at ACA is research developed and backed to ensure its effectiveness in teaching language skills that prepare students to study and master the finer points of the English language.\\nThe kind of attention given to the Language Arts curriculum is also given to the Math, Social Studies, and Science programs as well. All curriculum disciplines are scrutinized for content and alignment before they are accepted and incorporated as an integral part of the ACA curriculum. What we also look for in all ACA curriculum is the insurance that the process of teaching that curriculum leads to the development of higher order thinking skills in areas of reason and logic, analysis and synthesis.\\nIn addition, beginning in kindergarten, ACA students are taught music and art. The goal in these subjects is to afford the students generous opportunities to gain intimate familiarity with their beauty, history, and impact on our culture.\\nSpanish is offered beginning at the kindergarten level, serving as a practical tool in our modern world. Ultimately, as the school grows, Latin will be taught to enhance a deeper understanding and appreciation of the roots of our language and the sciences.\\nFinally, a physical education program is offered at all grades levels. Kinesthetic and motor skill development and lessons needed for lifelong physical wellness aid in the complete development of the child.\\nThe aggregation of this entire body of knowledge - the arts, the sciences, the languages, and physical education - embody what the ancient Greeks considered as teaching the entire child, mind, body, and soul.\\nEvaluation and Assessment Methods\\nThe most important element of our philosophy is our commitment to the relentless realization of our vision. ACA board members, administration, staff, parents, and students are encouraged to constantly look for ways to improve our school and, ultimately, student performance. Every voice counts in the support and realization of that improvement and in our effort to provide the best possible education for our students. This effort can result in occasional challenges as we evaluate our performance, but this constant and relentless assessment of our progress inevitably leads to improvement.\\nEvaluation and assessment also speaks to the way a determination is made regarding student performance. ACA teachers will consider strategic ways to ensure that what is being taught is what is being learned. Evaluation and assessment can take on a number of forms regarding performance and the ACA teacher will work to ensure that assessment, regardless of format, reflects knowledge learned by the student.\\nAcademic Principles at ACA\\nACA will use a combination of three sources for its teaching material, including Core Knowledge.\\xa0\\n\\xa0We will use the Trivium style of classical teaching whenever possible.\\nDr. E. D. Hirsch developed the Core Knowledge curriculum in 1986. A sequenced set of goals for K-8th grades make up its center, and teachers all over the world share in developing lesson plans based upon those goals.\\nThe Trivium style of teaching recognizes that children generally follow a predictable pattern of learning as they grow, and working within this pattern allows teachers to maximize their efforts. This pattern is generally considered to comprise three stages: grammar, logic, and rhetoric. In the grammar stage, children learn facts. In the logic stage, the pupils learn reasoning. Lastly, in the rhetoric stage, students are encouraged to use their factual knowledge and reasoning skills to be creative.\\nThe Trivium discusses the method by which students are taught, but does not specify what subjects are being taught. The combination of the curricula, provide a style of teaching that meshes well with a curriculum rich in factual knowledge.\\nOther Curriculum Information Links\\nAdvantages of D\\'Nealian Handwiring\\n5206 South Bowen Road\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArlington, TX 76017\\nPhone: 817-987-1819\\nFax: 817-200-6541\\nQuestions or Feedback?\\n | \\nBlackboard Web Community Manager Privacy Policy (Updated)\\n | \\nTerms of Use\\nCopyright Â© 2002-2018 Blackboard, Inc.
