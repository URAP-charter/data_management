Each campus offers a rigorous college \\n preparatory curriculum, and enables qualified Arizona resident students \\n to earn college-transferable credits while completing work for their high school diploma. AAEC Early College High Schools\\xa0teach the Arizona State Standards in all core curricula and is accredited by the North Central Association of Schools and Colleges.\\nHistory\\n Linda Proctor-Downing founded the college preparatory high school Arizona Agribusiness and Equine Center, Inc. in 1997. Her thirty plus years of classroom and administrative experience in creating and delivering innovative instruction and programs in equine sciences, agriculture and agribusiness became the foundation for the new venture. In order to offer students academically challenging courses beyond the high school curriculum, AAEC Early College High Schools embarked upon a partnership with South Mountain Community College in the Maricopa County Community College District. AAEC's collaboration with the community college permitted qualified students to take college courses while completing high school diploma requirements. These two critical design elements – the high school campus located near or on a college campus, and secondary students concurrently enrolled in college-level courses as part of their high school course of study – have become the defining features of all AAEC Early College High Schools.\\nEducation Evolved \\n Currently, AAEC Early College High Schools\\xa0is a thriving five-campus independent public high school district specializing in a college preparatory high school program with sites connected to\\xa0Mesa Community College, Paradise Valley Community College, South Mountain Community College,\\xa0Estrella Mountain Community College and now Yavapai Community College. AAEC has a reputation in the Valley for preparing students of various academic backgrounds and abilities for college level studies in all disciplines. Remaining true to its origins, AAEC Early College High Schools\\xa0continues to offer outstanding instruction in the sciences for students interested in careers in biotechnology, veterinarian studies, equine science and agriculture-related fields. AAEC is focused on preparing students for future success. Our teachers work with industry partners to update and strengthen our curriculum. We also study labor projections to focus our offerings on professions which will be in demand in the future. Each campus is designed to provide educational choice for up to 500 high school students. The schools attract students and families from all over the Phoenix Valley who have many different interests. Alumni studies show that graduates pursue a wide variety of college majors. Independent status allows AAEC, through an open enrollment policy, to draw a wide range of students from across the city and state to its uniquely blended high school/college model.\\nAAEC College Preparatory High Schools\\xa0Philosophy \\n Helping students to identify their interests and passions, and exploring how they can be used to discover and select career and real life work choices are central to our core mission of educating young adults for a technologically advanced society. Our faculty focuses instruction on student interests and academic and social needs. Students' interests and passions are nested in a rigorous core curriculum of English, Mathematics, Science, History and Foreign language. Each AAEC Early College High Schools\\xa0campus is an intimate community of caring adults and engaged students working in small groups allowing for personalized guidance and direction.\\nAAEC pledges to provide all students with what they need to succeed:\\nA superior academic program that meets students where they are academically and socially, and prepares them for college.\\nAdvanced coursework.\\nComprehensive student support services.\\nSmall classes and an intimate high school environment.\\nAn authentic college experience that allows students to enroll in college classes and participate fully in the life of the post-secondary partner.\\nExceptional Faculty \\n AAEC Early College High Schools\\xa0employ highly qualified instructors with substantial academic backgrounds as well as extensive professional experience.

School costs and salaries are also included. Students  will then \"learn the language\" as they are introduced to the medical terms for  each body system.  They will also begin \"medical  math\" where they calculate dosages of oral and injectable medications.\\nAnimal  Anatomy & Physiology \\n Students will learn the major bones, muscles, body parts and how  they function; then compare the similarities and differences between animal  species. They will build their own \"models\" of anatomical systems.\\nAnimal  Diseases \\n Students will learn the major diseases and problems for various  species and what vaccines we routinely administer to each.  They will learn what diseases affect both  animals and humans (Zoonotic) plus substantial time will be spent on biological  agents that can be used for Bioterrorism.\\nClinical  Techniques \\n These courses are strictly \"hands-on\", and are reserved for senior  students.  They begin with learning how  to take a proper medical history, physical restraint of all types of animals,  administering of medications, drawing blood and setting IV catheters, applying  bandages, anesthesia monitoring, surgical prep and sterile technique,  performing lab tests and operating medical equipment.\\nTeamwork and communication skills are heavily stressed.\\nIntro to Vet Science\\nDVM Educational Requirements and Costs     \\nPre-vet courses…..4 yrs average\\nApply to one of 28 Accredited Veterinary Schools in the US.

Is AAEC a \\n school for students with career interests other than in the sciences \\n or equine field? \\nWill college courses that AAEC students take while in high school\\n be accepted for transfer to 4-year colleges? \\nDo students\\' families have to pay for college courses?\\nHow many campuses does AAEC have? \\nWhat does a student\\'s transcript look like during their years of study? \\nAre AAEC students able to take honors courses? \\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWhat is AAEC?\\nAAEC is an Independent Public High School District with four campuses in partnership with Maricopa Community College District and one in partnership with Yavapai Community College district. A rigorous college preparatory curriculum is offered to students and at the same time enables them the opportunity to complete college courses for qualifying students while completing their high school diploma requirements.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWho is eligible to attend AAEC?\\nStudents prepared to enter 9th grade high school course work are eligible to attend AAEC. AAEC admits students of any race, gender, color, national and ethnic origin to all rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the high school. It does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, color, national and ethnic origin, disability, or limited English proficiency in administration of its educational policies, admission policies, scholarships and loan policies, athletic, CTE and other school administered programs.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWhy are AAEC\\'s high schools located on college campuses?\\nAAEC believes high school students properly prepared are able to handle college level courses while still in high school. College is more important than ever for professional success, yet the rising cost and poor preparation of many high school students prevent them from realizing their academic and career goals. The location of a high school on or near a college campus provides real connection to the next stage of learning and serves as a realistic goal and motivation for students to complete high school. Students attend college classes, receive college credit that also counts toward a high school diploma., Additionally, students have college ID cards and in many cases access to the entire college facility – a library, tutoring services, cafeterias, recreational facilities, theaters, language labs, a writing center, and additional computer labs.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nIs AAEC a school for smart students?\\nAAEC is a school for students of all abilities and preparation who wish to apply themselves to their academic interests in a safe and caring environment. Many qualifying students and earn college credit while still in high school.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWhy does AAEC have such a unique name?\\nArizona Agribusiness and Equine Center, Inc, or AAEC for short, was founded and named by Ms. Linda Proctor-Downing. The hands on approach to learning and teaching core curriculum that includes students\\' interests and passions are critical to its success. It was important to honor our roots and remain true to what made us successful yet bring our innovative teaching techniques and blended high school/college model to all students and families.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDo AAEC students receive a regular Arizona High School Diploma?\\nYes. AAEC\\'s curriculum meets the Arizona Department of Education requirements for high school graduation.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWhat is Agribusiness anyway and how can it help students identify their passion in life and turn it into a career?\\nAgriculture isn\\'t just straw hats, plows and sows. Everything that is eaten, most of the things that are worn, and many of the medicines that save lives, are products of agriculture. High-tech agriculture, especially the areas of plant and animal biotechnology are developing into very important industries for the United States and the entire world. The strong research component at AAEC helps students to develop strong inquiry skills. These skills lead to self-reflection enabling students to know who they are and what their passions and interests are in relation to career aspirations. Students who graduate from AAEC are clear about whom they are and what is their best course of study to achieve career goals.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWhy do some people refer to AAEC as the \"Horse School\"?\\nEquine science\\n and veterinarian studies are a strong on-going interest of many students at AAEC. The school has historically been able to meet this interest with hands on instruction and actually provides access to horses. The school will probably always be known for its outstanding curriculum in equine sciences but also has developed just as strong of a reputation for a general overall college preparatory curriculum. Many AAEC students decide to pursue other areas of study but all students have the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of an equine program and learn to ride if they wish.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWhat if a student wants to be a journalist or an actor? Is AAEC a school for students with career interests other than in the sciences or equine field?\\nAbsolutely! While many students decide to go into the sciences, many of our AAEC graduates major in liberal arts fields and pursue careers in business and other dynamic career areas. Our high school college prep curriculum combined with many courses offered by the Maricopa and Yavapai Community College Systems enable qualified Arizona resident students to graduate with an excellent high school education as well as a head start in college, sometimes with as much as two years of college transferable credits.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDo students\\' families have to pay for college courses?\\nCollege tuition and course fees for qualified Arizona resident students are paid for by AAEC as long as students meet satisfactory achievement marks of a C or better, which is considered passing by our school.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWill college courses that AAEC students take while in high school be accepted for transfer to 4-year colleges?\\nYes. All AAEC students meet yearly and often times more, with both the high school and college advisors, throughout the high school years. AAEC policy ensures that college tuition is paid for transferable college courses only at the 100 level and above. AAEC does not pay tuition for courses that do not transfer to accredited 2-year and 4-year colleges.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nHow many campuses does AAEC have?\\nAt present, there are \\nfive campuses\\n:\\nSouth Mountain on Baseline Road in Phoenix\\nParadise Valley on 32nd Street in Phoenix\\nRed Mountain on Power Road in Mesa\\nEstrella Mountain on Dysart in Avondale\\nPrescott Valley on Civic Circle Drive in Prescott Valley\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWhat does a student\\'s transcript look like during their years of study?\\nAAEC has developed a unique high school transcript that displays a record of all of a student\\'s courses from high school and college. It is a record that lets students, parents, college admissions personnel and AAEC faculty know exactly what courses students have taken, grades received, credits awarded for high school or college and the name of the course. The AAEC transcript is also used to track student and aggregate data for our student population, which is critical for our accountability and funding purposes.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nAre AAEC students able to take honors courses?\\nYes. Generally, since most college courses cover content area more deeply and at a faster pace, students receive an honors designation on the high school transcript for successful completion of college courses with grades of A, B, or C.\\nTop\\nHighly-Qualified Educators Who Make a Difference • Rich Curriculum that Exceeds State Standards • FREE COLLEGE TUITION*\\r\\n*For Qualified Arizona Resident Students\\nPrograms\\nOur Schools\\nFor Parents\\nStudent Life\\nAbout AAEC\\nSouth Mountain\\nParadise Valley\\nRed Mountain\\nEstrella Mountain\\nPrescott Valley\\nResources\\nTax Credit Form\\nPre-Enroll\\nSitemap\\nCareers\\nArizona Agribusiness & Equine Center\\n District Office\\n 3636 N Central Ave Suite 1050\\n Phoenix, AZ 85012\\n ph. 602-297-8500\\n fx. 602-297-8540\\nGoverning Board Meeting Agenda\\n© Copyright 2013 by Arizona Agribusiness & Equine Center.

In turn, our partnership with Paradise Valley Community College makes available all the resources and classes that college has to offer so that high school years are blended with the first stages of the college / university journey. If you have goals and want to get ahead, maybe it could be your journey.\\nI invite you to come for a visit and a chat, so that you can learn more about us and explore whether the AAEC-PV experience might be one for you.\\nMr. Hendrix\\nPrincipal\\nAbout AAEC-PV\\nNow in its 18th year of operation, the school has grown to 400 students in grades 9-12.\\nThe rationale of the Early College Experience at the school - and at all AAEC campuses - is the scheduling of students into appropriate, transferable college classes based on academic and social readiness, as well as on career and college plans. Some students, over four years of high school, graduate with not only their high school diploma, but also with an Associate\\'s Degree. In addition to the core classes, Certificates are offered in Equine Studies (AAEC has a nationally-recognized course sequence and program) and Veterinary Studies. Both are four-year elective programs.\\nAlong the way, opportunity exists, especially given the size of the school, for students to participate in and enjoy a wide variety of extracurricular activities. In recent years, teams of students have represented Arizona in national competition: National History Day in Washington, D.C.; Horse Judging and Veterinary Tech in Indianapolis; and Environthon in Pennsylvania. Many individuals have competed in a variety of equine events in the Western States; others have completed International Conservation Internships in South Africa.\\nAdd in our small class sizes and the academic support available on campus, and it\\'s apparent we offer a unique educational experience. And those college classes? Free to qualified Arizona residents!\\nAAEC\\'s program addresses the rigor and relevance so critical to a college-prep, life-prep education. It requires students to give back to their communities.\\nWe are currently enrolling qualified applicants in grades 9-12.\\nStaff & Teacher Info\\nStudent Handbook\\nProgram of Studies\\nSupply List\\nParadise Valley Calendar\\nSchool Days Off Calendar\\nGraduation Requirements\\nAssociate in Arts Graduation Requirements\\nParentVUE / StudentVUE\\nCommunity Service Time Sheet\\nCollege Course Attendance Log\\nParent Partners\\nCommunity Service Events Calendar\\nTax Credit Donation\\nEnroll in our \\nParadise Valley public charter schools\\n and start earning college credits today.

Our philosophy \\nis to challenge students to  improve their mastery of reading, writing and math skills to meet the higher  levels of work in a university or college setting.\\nAAEC high schools developed each of their curriculums by  best practices and core values and standards as stated by the Arizona  Department of Education.  Each year,  their teachers revise, rewrite, update and review the curriculums they teach.  These curriculums must align with all state mandated  standards as well as align with community college and universities standards.\\nEach of the core curriculums  as developed by the teachers and administrators at AAEC must meet certain  college prep standards.  These standards  would include higher levels of reading, writing and advanced math skills.  Each level of the curriculums includes skills  in research and writing using Modern Language Association guidelines.\\nWhy AAEC?\\nThe opportunity to earn college credit while attending a college prep high school is more advantageous to highly motivated students that are college centered. AAEC High Schools will challenge students to reach higher for the opportunity to attend college.\\nStudents that attend AAEC high schools develop a strong sense of responsibility, organization, time management skills and writing skills to be competitive in a university setting.  Students learn high levels of research methods and how to write as a college student.\\nOne of the best benefits of students attending an AAEC college prep high school is their opportunity to take transferable college courses that are used when they transfer to a university of their choice.  On average students can transfer over 50+ community college course that equates close to a $30,000 savings in a university.\\nEnroll your child in our  \\ncollege prep high school\\n and start earning college credits\\xa0today.

In turn, our partnership with Paradise Valley Community College makes available all the resources and classes that college has to offer so that high school years are blended with the first stages of the college / university journey. If you have goals and want to get ahead, maybe it could be your journey.\\nI invite you to come for a visit and a chat, so that you can learn more about us and explore whether the AAEC-PV experience might be one for you.\\nMr. Hendrix\\nPrincipal\\nAbout AAEC-PV\\nNow in its 18th year of operation, the school has grown to 400 students in grades 9-12.\\nThe rationale of the Early College Experience at the school - and at all AAEC campuses - is the scheduling of students into appropriate, transferable college classes based on academic and social readiness, as well as on career and college plans. Some students, over four years of high school, graduate with not only their high school diploma, but also with an Associate\\'s Degree. In addition to the core classes, Certificates are offered in Equine Studies (AAEC has a nationally-recognized course sequence and program) and Veterinary Studies. Both are four-year elective programs.\\nAlong the way, opportunity exists, especially given the size of the school, for students to participate in and enjoy a wide variety of extracurricular activities. In recent years, teams of students have represented Arizona in national competition: National History Day in Washington, D.C.; Horse Judging and Veterinary Tech in Indianapolis; and Environthon in Pennsylvania. Many individuals have competed in a variety of equine events in the Western States; others have completed International Conservation Internships in South Africa.\\nAdd in our small class sizes and the academic support available on campus, and it\\'s apparent we offer a unique educational experience. And those college classes? Free to qualified Arizona residents!\\nAAEC\\'s program addresses the rigor and relevance so critical to a college-prep, life-prep education. It requires students to give back to their communities.\\nWe are currently enrolling qualified applicants in grades 9-12.\\nStaff & Teacher Info\\nStudent Handbook\\nProgram of Studies\\nSupply List\\nParadise Valley Calendar\\nSchool Days Off Calendar\\nGraduation Requirements\\nAssociate in Arts Graduation Requirements\\nParentVUE / StudentVUE\\nCommunity Service Time Sheet\\nCollege Course Attendance Log\\nParent Partners\\nCommunity Service Events Calendar\\nTax Credit Donation\\nEnroll in our \\nParadise Valley public charter schools\\n and start earning college credits today.

Is AAEC a \\n school for students with career interests other than in the sciences \\n or equine field? \\nWill college courses that AAEC students take while in high school\\n be accepted for transfer to 4-year colleges? \\nDo students\\' families have to pay for college courses?\\nHow many campuses does AAEC have? \\nWhat does a student\\'s transcript look like during their years of study? \\nAre AAEC students able to take honors courses? \\n --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWhat is AAEC?\\nAAEC is an Independent Public High School District with four campuses in partnership with Maricopa Community College District and one in partnership with Yavapai Community College district. A rigorous college preparatory curriculum is offered to students and at the same time enables them the opportunity to complete college courses for qualifying students while completing their high school diploma requirements.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWho is eligible to attend AAEC?\\nStudents prepared to enter 9th grade high school course work are eligible to attend AAEC. AAEC admits students of any race, gender, color, national and ethnic origin to all rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the high school. It does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, color, national and ethnic origin, disability, or limited English proficiency in administration of its educational policies, admission policies, scholarships and loan policies, athletic, CTE and other school administered programs.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWhy are AAEC\\'s high schools located on college campuses?\\nAAEC believes high school students properly prepared are able to handle college level courses while still in high school. College is more important than ever for professional success, yet the rising cost and poor preparation of many high school students prevent them from realizing their academic and career goals. The location of a high school on or near a college campus provides real connection to the next stage of learning and serves as a realistic goal and motivation for students to complete high school. Students attend college classes, receive college credit that also counts toward a high school diploma., Additionally, students have college ID cards and in many cases access to the entire college facility – a library, tutoring services, cafeterias, recreational facilities, theaters, language labs, a writing center, and additional computer labs.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nIs AAEC a school for smart students?\\nAAEC is a school for students of all abilities and preparation who wish to apply themselves to their academic interests in a safe and caring environment. Many qualifying students and earn college credit while still in high school.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWhy does AAEC have such a unique name?\\nArizona Agribusiness and Equine Center, Inc, or AAEC for short, was founded and named by Ms. Linda Proctor-Downing. The hands on approach to learning and teaching core curriculum that includes students\\' interests and passions are critical to its success. It was important to honor our roots and remain true to what made us successful yet bring our innovative teaching techniques and blended high school/college model to all students and families.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDo AAEC students receive a regular Arizona High School Diploma?\\nYes. AAEC\\'s curriculum meets the Arizona Department of Education requirements for high school graduation.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWhat is Agribusiness anyway and how can it help students identify their passion in life and turn it into a career?\\nAgriculture isn\\'t just straw hats, plows and sows. Everything that is eaten, most of the things that are worn, and many of the medicines that save lives, are products of agriculture. High-tech agriculture, especially the areas of plant and animal biotechnology are developing into very important industries for the United States and the entire world. The strong research component at AAEC helps students to develop strong inquiry skills. These skills lead to self-reflection enabling students to know who they are and what their passions and interests are in relation to career aspirations. Students who graduate from AAEC are clear about whom they are and what is their best course of study to achieve career goals.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWhy do some people refer to AAEC as the \"Horse School\"?\\nEquine science\\n and veterinarian studies are a strong on-going interest of many students at AAEC. The school has historically been able to meet this interest with hands on instruction and actually provides access to horses. The school will probably always be known for its outstanding curriculum in equine sciences but also has developed just as strong of a reputation for a general overall college preparatory curriculum. Many AAEC students decide to pursue other areas of study but all students have the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of an equine program and learn to ride if they wish.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWhat if a student wants to be a journalist or an actor? Is AAEC a school for students with career interests other than in the sciences or equine field?\\nAbsolutely! While many students decide to go into the sciences, many of our AAEC graduates major in liberal arts fields and pursue careers in business and other dynamic career areas. Our high school college prep curriculum combined with many courses offered by the Maricopa and Yavapai Community College Systems enable qualified Arizona resident students to graduate with an excellent high school education as well as a head start in college, sometimes with as much as two years of college transferable credits.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDo students\\' families have to pay for college courses?\\nCollege tuition and course fees for qualified Arizona resident students are paid for by AAEC as long as students meet satisfactory achievement marks of a C or better, which is considered passing by our school.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWill college courses that AAEC students take while in high school be accepted for transfer to 4-year colleges?\\nYes. All AAEC students meet yearly and often times more, with both the high school and college advisors, throughout the high school years. AAEC policy ensures that college tuition is paid for transferable college courses only at the 100 level and above. AAEC does not pay tuition for courses that do not transfer to accredited 2-year and 4-year colleges.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nHow many campuses does AAEC have?\\nAt present, there are \\nfive campuses\\n:\\nSouth Mountain on Baseline Road in Phoenix\\nParadise Valley on 32nd Street in Phoenix\\nRed Mountain on Power Road in Mesa\\nEstrella Mountain on Dysart in Avondale\\nPrescott Valley on Civic Circle Drive in Prescott Valley\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWhat does a student\\'s transcript look like during their years of study?\\nAAEC has developed a unique high school transcript that displays a record of all of a student\\'s courses from high school and college. It is a record that lets students, parents, college admissions personnel and AAEC faculty know exactly what courses students have taken, grades received, credits awarded for high school or college and the name of the course. The AAEC transcript is also used to track student and aggregate data for our student population, which is critical for our accountability and funding purposes.\\nTop\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nAre AAEC students able to take honors courses?\\nYes. Generally, since most college courses cover content area more deeply and at a faster pace, students receive an honors designation on the high school transcript for successful completion of college courses with grades of A, B, or C.\\nTop\\nHighly-Qualified Educators Who Make a Difference • Rich Curriculum that Exceeds State Standards • FREE COLLEGE TUITION*\\r\\n*For Qualified Arizona Resident Students\\nPrograms\\nOur Schools\\nFor Parents\\nStudent Life\\nAbout AAEC\\nSouth Mountain\\nParadise Valley\\nRed Mountain\\nEstrella Mountain\\nPrescott Valley\\nResources\\nTax Credit Form\\nPre-Enroll\\nSitemap\\nCareers\\nArizona Agribusiness & Equine Center\\n District Office\\n 3636 N Central Ave Suite 1050\\n Phoenix, AZ 85012\\n ph. 602-297-8500\\n fx. 602-297-8540\\nGoverning Board Meeting Agenda\\n© Copyright 2013 by Arizona Agribusiness & Equine Center.

The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children\\'s education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are \"eligible students.\"\\nParents or eligible students have the right to inspect and review the student\\'s education records maintained by the school. Schools are not required to provide copies of records unless, for reasons such as great distance, it is impossible for parents or eligible students to review the records. Schools may charge a fee for copies.\\nParents or eligible students have the right to request that a school correct records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. If the school decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student then has the right to a formal hearing. After the hearing, if the school still decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student has the right to place a statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested information.\\nGenerally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student\\'s education record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR § 99.31):\\nSchool officials with legitimate educational interest;\\nOther schools to which a student is transferring;\\nSpecified officials for audit or evaluation purposes;\\nAppropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student;\\nOrganizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school;\\nAccrediting organizations;\\nTo comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena;\\nAppropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and\\nState and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law.\\nSchools may disclose, without consent, \"directory\" information such as a student\\'s name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance. However, schools must tell parents and eligible students about directory information and allow parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose directory information about them. Schools must notify parents and eligible students annually of their rights under FERPA. The actual means of notification (special letter, inclusion in a PTA bulletin, student handbook, or newspaper article) is left to the discretion of each school.\\nHighly-Qualified Educators Who Make a Difference • Rich Curriculum that Exceeds State Standards • FREE COLLEGE TUITION*\\r\\n*For Qualified Arizona Resident Students\\nPrograms\\nOur Schools\\nFor Parents\\nStudent Life\\nAbout AAEC\\nSouth Mountain\\nParadise Valley\\nRed Mountain\\nEstrella Mountain\\nPrescott Valley\\nResources\\nTax Credit Form\\nPre-Enroll\\nSitemap\\nCareers\\nArizona Agribusiness & Equine Center\\n District Office\\n 3636 N Central Ave Suite 1050\\n Phoenix, AZ 85012\\n ph. 602-297-8500\\n fx. 602-297-8540\\nGoverning Board Meeting Agenda\\n© Copyright 2013 by Arizona Agribusiness & Equine Center.

Statistics? Chance? Apply For a “No Essay” Scholarship!\\nPosted on \\nMay 30, 2017\\nby \\nFWadmin\\nPlanning for college and beyond requires you to be a student of money, big data and statistics—while also being a student at AAEC. You can use all of these subjects in the real world with a big data company based in Pennsylvania that offers a “no essay” contest for high school and college students could win a $2,000 scholarship.\\nWant to play?  \\nNiche, based in Pittsburgh, is a company that helps people discover schools and neighborhoods that match with a desired lifestyle. They analyze “public data sets and millions of reviews to produce comprehensive rankings, report cards, and profiles for every K-12 school, college, and neighborhood in the U.S.” If you’re curious as to where all this data comes from, you can see it all here: www.about.niche.com/data/\\nWhile AAEC does not endorse Niche, the opportunity to enter their scholarship contest might be of interest to our students. The contest is open to “All high school and college students, as well as anyone looking to attend college or graduate school in the next year.” The rules of the contest may be found here: www. about.niche.com/scholarship-rules/no-essay-scholarship/\\nOne winner is selected by a random drawing every month, and you can apply once each month. The $2,000 may be used for tuition, housing, books or other education related expenses. Winners are announced in Niche’s e-newsletter and on the Scholarship Winners page.\\nLet us at AAEC know if you win!\\nPosted in \\nUncategorized\\n|\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nLeave a comment\\nTree Rings: The New Kind of Record on a Turntable\\nPosted on \\nMay 18, 2017\\nby \\nFWadmin\\n A DJ or Disc Jockey makes his or her living with vinyl records, turntables, speakers and a creative playlist. But here’s what happens when the DJ is a media artist and the LP is a disc made of wood:\\nhttp://www.cpr.org/classical/blog/turntable-plays-tree-rings-instead-vinyl-grooves-how-did-he-do\\nOne of the skills you should be learning in school is how to see old things in new ways. That’s what Bartholomaus Traubeck did when he saw the potential for music in the “year rings” of a tree trunk. Of course, if you matched up a needle and some speakers with rotating slice of circular wood, the needle would cut it’s own groove in the cellulose and not pick up any sound at all. Forget the needle. Traubeck used a camera to measure the spaces between the rings, their thickness and other textural considerations, then the data was analyzed and translated into notes to be played on a piano.\\nOf course, this involves the power of algorithm, scale…and imagination.\\nTraubeck found that different types of trees “play” different modalities of sound. Fir trees are fast growers; they have large gaps between their rings. The music they ‘produce’ sounds very spare and modern…in Traubeck’s chosen key of C minor. Trees with close-together rings, such as the Ash, play much more complex sounds.\\nUnlike the consistency you’d hear if you played Jethro Tull’s 1977 album titled “Songs From The Wood” over and over, each tree ring sings to the beat of its own drummer. That’s because each time he plays a tree, Traubeck has to decide where on the slab of wood to begin the ‘song.’\\nBe curious! What do you think the Blue Palo Verde or Ponderosa Pine might sound like?\\nPosted in \\nUncategorized\\n|\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nLeave a comment\\nIn From Africa: What Dean Rice, DVM, Director of Veterinary Science at AAEC learned while hosting visitors Dr. William Fowlds and Schalk Pretorius\\nPosted on \\nMay 9, 2017\\nby \\nFWadmin\\n            Dean Rice, DVM has a passion for animals, veterinary medicine, teaching (at both AAEC and Midwestern University), travel and people who care about the welfare of planet Earth. That’s why he inspired Dr. William Fowlds and Schalk Pretorius to come from South Africa to Arizona to meet with AAEC students over the past week.\\n            How did Dr. Rice meet Dr. Fowlds and Schalk Pretorius? Before retiring from his work at the Phoenix Zoo, Rice worked with the two men eight years ago to “create a hands-on safari,” one where it was possible to do more than just see the beauty of the exotic species of the African plains. “I wanted to touch the animals,” he said.  He’s been taking AAEC students on safari as a supplement to the education they receive at AAEC—in fact the one planned for this summer will be his sixth. Rice has been teaching at AAEC for seven years.\\n            In the course of visiting AAEC’s campuses this week, Dr. Fowlds reported that after his presentation on the endangerment of rhinos in South Africa and Asia, a young woman student thanked him…with tears of compassion for these animals. Dr. Rice said that the presentations Dr. Fowlds gave “were eye opening,” and explained that when he spoke of the crisis of poaching, “students were able to relate to that reality” in very personal ways.\\n            The message Dr. Fowlds left with students was that “losing 1,000 rhinos a year in South Africa due to illegal wildlife trade and the organized crime behind it” is what’s leading to the endangerment of so many species of wildlife there and in the world. His mission is to “raise awareness of how small the world is,” and that Americans should act to send a message to people in other countries, particularly those in Southeast Asia, that purchases of exotic species causes brutal, traumatic suffering to these animals and there is also a cost in human emotional impact. “These creatures’ lives are interlinked with ours. We can only do conservation of natural environments with these iconic species because they are what bring visitors, and it’s the visitors who pay for their conservation. This is a global responsibility.”\\n            In addition to their campus visits, Dr. Rice took Fowlds and Pretorius to see the Grand Canyon. Dr. Fowlds said, “Arizonans need to realize how beautiful their landscape is…we all must connect to our natural spaces so we do not lose them. We need these spaces to keep ourselves sane.”\\nDr. Dean Rice\\nPosted in \\nUncategorized\\n|\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nLeave a comment\\nExtra Curriculum: The Physics of A Scorpion’s Tail\\nPosted on \\nApril 25, 2017\\nby \\nFWadmin\\nThe curriculum at AAEC enables students to earn college credits while completing work for their high school diploma. The school’s blog now offers some “extra curriculum” news for faculty, students, parents and friends. Every now and then, we’ll feature news items regarding science, linguistics, history, math and other academic topics that arise in current events—this is what lifelong learning is all about!\\nMatch several varieties of scorpion, all in the act of stinging, with a high-speed camera and what do you get?  An interesting result! Leiurus quinquestriatus or the Deathstalker scorpion is capable of whipping its tail over its head at a rate of 51 inches per second.\\nAccording to information on this website (which also includes videos that capture the arc of the stinger and tail), \\nhttps://phys.org/news/2017-04-world-venomous-scorpion-action.html\\n “A comparison of half-a-dozen scorpion species shown in ultra-slow motion revealed an unsuspected variety of strike modes, they reported in the journal Functional Ecology.” Tail shape affects stinging motion, and the still unanswered questions relate to why the strike patterns are so varied.\\nThere are at least 50 species of scorpion that live in Arizona; 13 of them live in the mountainous regions of the state. A new species was discovered in 2013:  Vaejovis brysoni. It’s one thing to see a scorpion in the act of stinging in a laboratory and quite another to see one sting…in person. If you live in or near a scorpion habitat, strike back by shaking out your shoes, hats and other items of apparel before you wear them.\\nPosted in \\nUncategorized\\n|\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nLeave a comment\\nMeet Chris Chung, Class of 2017\\nPosted on \\nApril 18, 2017\\nby \\nFWadmin\\nOn this blog, you’ve read letters from an AAEC alumni to their former high school self. This month, meet a soon-to-graduate student from the Estrella Mountain campus. Instead of a letter-to-self, we interviewed Christopher Chung about the years he spent at AAEC.\\n Christopher Chung (who goes by Chris) may have walked before he learned to crawl. He says, “I flew planes before I drove cars.” \\n\\tAnd, thanks to AAEC, he also went to college before he ‘went to college.’ As he faces graduation, he’s appreciative that he has made inroads to his higher education. “Take advantage of the free college while you can, because college is expensive,” is the advice Chris gives to incoming students at any campus, during any year.\\n\\t Realizing that some teachers care very much about their students and help them succeed was one of the most profound experiences Chris had during his high school years. He says that his AAEC teachers played a role in pretty much everything he did, all the way through. “Ms. Wentworth and Mrs. Reyes have been there to help me with the college application process and with my personal goal of achieving an appointment to Service Academies of the United States Military.”\\n\\tDuring his three years as a student at AAEC, Chris was in the medical club and served as vice president for the National Honor Society. When he was not on campus, his time was spent in Boy Scouts, Civil Air Patrol, the Experimental Aircraft Association, Tuskegee Airmen, Inc., and he did some exploring with law enforcement officials engaged in solving crimes. Chris has been busy while at AAEC and advises students who have energy similar to his to “expect a lot of a work but it will be worth it because you will have a bigger payoff then most high school graduates.” \\n\\tSometimes, losses happen. Chris advises, “You will also make and lose friends but that’s OK. Stay focused on school but have an outlet outside of school where you can relieve stress. Don’t get too wrapped up in school; remember to live life while it’s happening and just have fun with this experience.” \\n\\tThere are many opportunities inside of AAEC where students may keep busy with learning—and enjoying life. Chris reminds them that “there’s a greater endpoint and you’ll make lasting relationships.” \\nPosted in \\nUncategorized\\n|\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nLeave a comment\\nAfrican Game Preserve Dignitaries, Dr. William Fowlds and Schalk Pretorius to Visit All AAEC Campuses, April 30 – May 3, 2017\\nPosted on \\nApril 11, 2017\\nby \\nFWadmin\\n\\tIs there a visit to Africa in your future? Is going on a safari a dream of yours? Two visitors from Africa are sure you’ll answer “yes” to both questions after you get to meet them!\\n\\tThe AAEC community of students, staff and parents—prepare to welcome Dr. William Fowlds, a wildlife veterinarian and conservationist who practices in the Eastern Cape, and Schalk Pretorius, a Level 3 Field Guide of Southern Africa.\\n\\tBefore you learn about Dr. Fowlds, think about the rhinoceros. Species are native to Asia and Africa. A rhino’s horn is similar to horse’s hooves. Earth dwellers for 50 million years, portraits of rhinos have appeared in cave drawings. In recent times, some species have come back from near-extinction to thrive.\\n\\tDr. Fowlds will share how he partnered with Medivet UK and Saving the Survivors to create awareness for the plight of rhinos. He works to rescue rhinos endangered by poachers. His conservation experience includes the conversion of a fifth-generation family owned domestic farm and neighboring properties into the Amakhala Game Reserve. Dr. Fowlds considers it a privilege to get to know rhinos as individuals. He connects students who are interested in veterinary medicine with diverse African wildlife through ITV and Animal Planet through “Vets Go Wild” and the “Safari Vet School” programs. Find Dr. Fowlds on Facebook at www.facebook.com/pg/DrWilliamFowlds/about\\n\\tWhat’s it like to guide a safari and/or observe wild animals in the African bush?\\nA guide since 1996, Schalk Pretorius has a passion and dedication for training and developing guides. He coordinates and guides the team at Ulovane Environmental Training (http://ulovane.co.za/aboutulovane/meet-the-team/), a school near the Amakhala Game Reserve to ensure that students are provided with the best education and personal development to become guides and providers of hospitality to those who visit Africa.\\n\\tIn addition, Schalk is certified in Special Knowledge and Skills (SKS) in Dangerous Animals & Birds and is a qualified Marine Guide and Tracker. Since 2001, he’s been an accredited Culture Arts Tourist, Hospitality Sports Sector Education and Training Authority assessor. Schalk is a great motivational speaker and has inspired, coached and assisted many people over the years.\\n\\tThe founder of AAEC, Linda Downing, believes one of the best ways to learn is person-to-person. Learning becomes extraordinary when persons like Pretorius and Fowlds bring their expertise and unique views from afar to our students in Arizona.\\nPosted in \\nUncategorized\\n|\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nLeave a comment\\nAAEC Alumni Letter to Self: Spence\\nPosted on \\nApril 3, 2017\\nby \\nFWadmin\\nEvery month the AAEC blog publishes\\xa0a letter from an AAEC alumni to their former high school self. Our alumni letter for December\\xa0is\\xa0Spencer Brickell. As a 2013 graduate from AAEC, Spencer Brickell continued her education at The University of Arizona. Having been highly active in FFA during high school, Spencer continued within the organization during a year of service as an Arizona Association State FFA Officer. Afterwards she continued working for Arizona FFA as a conference curriculum developer and facilitator. Spencer recently graduated from the U of A with a Bachelor of Science in Informal Education. She will be pursuing a Masters Degree in Adult and Higher Education from the University of Oklahoma beginning August 2016.\\nSpencer, Spencer, Spencer,\\nWhere to start? You’re moving to a brand new school, your hair is bright blue, and you feel as if you need to have your life plan all figured out. Well I hate to tell you but the blue will fade to a horrendous chlorine green and yes, it will look as awful as it sounds. Fortunately, the move to AAEC will go tremendously better than your hairdo and will help you with that life plan you’re consistently worrying about.\\nAAEC is large enough that you’ll have the opportunity to meet different people, but small enough for everyone to be a family. After the first month, the fears of not being accepted will diminish away. You’ll be taking classes at the local community college which will allow you to explore different career paths and prepare you for life at university (and trust me, in 3 years\\xa0when you’re at the University of Arizona, you will be filled with gratitude that you already know how to schedule courses).

Our alumni letter for December\\xa0is\\xa0Sommer is a 2016 graduate from AAEC who also received her Associate of Arts Degree from Yavapai Community College. She is currently applying to Western Governors University to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Business. She is a mentor for Youth Outdoors Unlimited which is a nonprofit organization that takes kids and young adults out to teach them wildlife conservation, being an ethical hunter/huntress, build confidence, and experience a strong community bond. She is currently training her horse to barrel race. She currently works in a small business as the Service Coordinator and plans to open her own small business someday.\\nDear Sommer,\\nHere you are, starting high school.\\nJoin clubs, FFA and Horsemanship Club are perfect fits for you. Go out and watch the farrier put shoes on, watch the vet give medication and shots. You will regret it if you don’t.\\nDo not, I repeat, do not let your grades slip and expect to get them up at the last second. The teachers are there after classes, during lunch, before school, even available on weekends to help you. Call, text, or email them, they will do anything to help you. The principal may also seem scary at first, he’s really very sweet and nice.\\nWhen it comes to college classes and reaching that great accomplishment of your Associates of Arts degree, don’t cram it all in your senior year.\\nSpread the classes out. It is a HUGE difference from high school, but I know you can do it. Talk to your teachers, they are your friends, not your enemies. Even though you don’t think they are there to help you they are. Many do not know that you are still in high school and taking college classes. Talk to them, they will help you.\\nGetting your AA degree is worth it. I mean come on, how many other 17 years olds can say they have an AA degree? Not many…so smile until your cheeks turn red and laugh until your belly hurts. These are the memories you will keep with you forever.\\nS.\\nPosted in \\nUncategorized\\n|\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nLeave a comment\\nAAEC March Rockstar\\nPosted on \\nMarch 13, 2017\\nby \\nFWadmin\\nEvery month AAEC’s blog publishes something by current AAEC students.

During that time, she received an AA degree along with her high school diploma. She was President of Archery Club and of National Honor Society. She completed the Veterinary Science Program and Horsemanship classes though AAEC as well. Isabella Wheeler will continue to pursue higher education to fulfill her dream of facilitating aid to the public through medicine.\\nWelcome to AAEC Isabella!\\nIt is your first day and your mom just dropped you off with your cousin Caleb at the gates. He has already rushed in, eager to meet new friends. You, of course, are distressed, self-conscious, and anxious.\\nThe feeling will pass, but you need to put in some effort to make friends. While all of these new people seem distant, a lot of them are captivating, amiable people that you will love knowing. You will graduate with only 38 of them, so make your time last while they are there.\\nYou have your mind set on straight A’s and an AA degree. It will be a tough path, but I promise you, it will be okay. You have your classmates and teachers to rely on when you start to crash. Remember to frame your goals before you dive in. Slow down, but work hard. That sounds contradictory doesn’t it? With time, you will understand what I mean.\\nYou will come to find that some people are not worth your time. Do not feel bad when things go awry, stand tall, rise again. Focus on the people who do matter. Some of the best friends you will make will be people you initially thought were strange or too different from you. AAEC hosts some of the most caring, dependable people you will ever have the chance to know. Differences actually add to friendships, remember that.\\nTake risks, smart risks and invest in yourself. This is a hard lesson to learn, which is why you will inevitably dance with depression. The only way to make it out is to accept yourself. You will find that everyone and everything you need surrounds you every day.\\nNow for the fun part.. romance. You will fall in love with someone you meet your Freshman year. Unfortunately I’m not here to spoil the details. The one thing I will say is to never give up, even when you have rough patches. If you stay strong, your love will too.\\nHave fun and stay safe…your older self is counting on it!\\nIsabella Wheeler\\nP.S.

With the SCLC, helped organize the 1963 nonviolent protests in Birmingham, Alabama.

Our alumni letter for December\\xa0is\\xa0Amanda Mikrut, a future Elementary Teacher. She is currently a Junior at Arizona State University. She graduated AAEC Prescott Valley second in her class with a 4.0. During high school she also managed to take enough classes at Yavapai Community College to graduate concurrently with an Associates of Arts. Outside of academics she loves doing work for her community and volunteering with children. Amanda has lived in Arizona most her life and intends on staying in this state to help fill the teacher deficit and improve education standards.\\nDear Amanda,\\nThe key to getting through High School like a champ is easy. It breaks down to three things: academics, friends and family, and your mental stability. When it comes to academics you need to constantly remind yourself that you are stronger and more capable than you think you are. You can do it.\\xa0 When you are struggling to stay awake those late nights, when you have an 8 page draft due in the morning and a giant exam the following afternoon, know that you are going to do great and great things will in turn happen because of your hard work. You may not get the recognition for graduating college while still in high school now but it will come in the future. Stay relentless and motivated and take a deep breath.\\xa0 Try to remember that it is important to take breaks and give yourself the credit you deserve. It will seem overwhelming at times. The key to overcoming this is to go to the gas station down the street, get an ice cold tea, go to the library and one by one knock things off of your to-do list. You need to prioritize everything from school and life and continue to push forward and overcome obstacles.\\nFriends and family will remain your back bone and sanity through most of this, so do not shut them out. Make plans and don’t cancel them. Enjoy the time you have with them because some of them will not be graduating with you.\\nLastly, remember to take time for yourself.\\xa0 It is healthy to need to lie down and watch an episode of Netflix or read a bit of a book to regain your rationality. You need balance. Hang out with friends after you finish that paper. Go shopping with your mother to reward yourself for the project you spent weeks on.\\nKeep planning your future and don’t lose sight of what you have done and what you are working for.\\nFind balance between your happiness, your success, and spending time with the people around you. Your future is so bright.

AAEC students are rockstars and we have some amazing stories to tell! By publishing once a month, we can share our exciting and personal stories with one another across the five campuses. Our rockstar for November is Eliam Quintana. Elias provides his point of view as a freshman at AAEC this year:\\xa0\\nFreshman Point of View\\nHello,\\nMy name is Eliam and I am a freshman at AAEC Prescott Valley campus. I believe that at AAEC everyone looks out for each other and encourages and respects one another.\\nAs I start my day at AAEC I usually meet up with my friends and we talk until the first bell. After the first bell, I go to my my first class which is Algebra 1 with Mr. Duarte. In class we take notes, work on assignments and get the homework assignment. I like how the teachers have their own individual teaching methods to help us comprehend the lesson. I also like how after class I get a whole different experience by being one on one with horses in the barn. Everyday is different. Sometimes I’m riding a horse and another day I’m taking care of the horses and shoveling horse waste.\\nEnglish, I would say, is one of the best classes because my teacher Mrs. Parker makes teaching so fun and creative. Mr. Reinsmith also does the same thing. I finish up with the rest of my classes and when the day is done my mom picks me up. But I always enjoy my day and can’t wait to come back the next day. I’m glad to attend this school and to be able to take advantage of all the opportunities it offers.\\nAAEC has allowed me a new kind of class experience. I am in a small class environment getting one on one attention from my teachers. I am encouraged to be myself and let my mind explore different aspects of learning. In this short time that I have been enrolled I feel that my education is in my hands, it is my responsibility. As a student I have so many extracurricular activities to choose from. Personally, I love Archery. I feel my possibilities are endless as a student of AAEC.\\nAAEC is a great education!\\nEliam Quintana\\nLeave a comment\\n← Older posts\\nNewer posts \\n→\\nPrograms\\nOur Schools\\nFor Parents\\nStudent Life\\nAbout AAEC\\nSouth Mountain\\nParadise Valley\\nRed Mountain\\nEstrella Mountain\\nPrescott Valley\\nResources\\nPre-Enroll\\nSitemap\\nArizona Agribusiness & Equine Center\\n District Office\\n 3636 N Central Ave Suite 1050\\n Phoenix, AZ 85012\\n ph. 602-297-8500\\n fx. 602-297-8540\\n© Copyright 2013 by Arizona Agribusiness & Equine Center.

Our alumni letter for December\\xa0is\\xa0Sommer is a 2016 graduate from AAEC who also received her Associate of Arts Degree from Yavapai Community College. She is currently applying to Western Governors University to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Business. She is a mentor for Youth Outdoors Unlimited which is a nonprofit organization that takes kids and young adults out to teach them wildlife conservation, being an ethical hunter/huntress, build confidence, and experience a strong community bond. She is currently training her horse to barrel race. She currently works in a small business as the Service Coordinator and plans to open her own small business someday.\\nDear Sommer,\\nHere you are, starting high school.\\nJoin clubs, FFA and Horsemanship Club are perfect fits for you. Go out and watch the farrier put shoes on, watch the vet give medication and shots. You will regret it if you don’t.\\nDo not, I repeat, do not let your grades slip and expect to get them up at the last second. The teachers are there after classes, during lunch, before school, even available on weekends to help you. Call, text, or email them, they will do anything to help you. The principal may also seem scary at first, he’s really very sweet and nice.\\nWhen it comes to college classes and reaching that great accomplishment of your Associates of Arts degree, don’t cram it all in your senior year.\\nSpread the classes out. It is a HUGE difference from high school, but I know you can do it. Talk to your teachers, they are your friends, not your enemies. Even though you don’t think they are there to help you they are. Many do not know that you are still in high school and taking college classes. Talk to them, they will help you.\\nGetting your AA degree is worth it. I mean come on, how many other 17 years olds can say they have an AA degree? Not many…so smile until your cheeks turn red and laugh until your belly hurts. These are the memories you will keep with you forever.\\nS.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n.

Is going on a safari a dream of yours? Two visitors from Africa are sure you’ll answer “yes” to both questions after you get to meet them!\\n\\tThe AAEC community of students, staff and parents—prepare to welcome Dr. William Fowlds, a wildlife veterinarian and conservationist who practices in the Eastern Cape, and Schalk Pretorius, a Level 3 Field Guide of Southern Africa.\\n\\tBefore you learn about Dr. Fowlds, think about the rhinoceros. Species are native to Asia and Africa. A rhino’s horn is similar to horse’s hooves. Earth dwellers for 50 million years, portraits of rhinos have appeared in cave drawings. In recent times, some species have come back from near-extinction to thrive.\\n\\tDr. Fowlds will share how he partnered with Medivet UK and Saving the Survivors to create awareness for the plight of rhinos. He works to rescue rhinos endangered by poachers. His conservation experience includes the conversion of a fifth-generation family owned domestic farm and neighboring properties into the Amakhala Game Reserve. Dr. Fowlds considers it a privilege to get to know rhinos as individuals. He connects students who are interested in veterinary medicine with diverse African wildlife through ITV and Animal Planet through “Vets Go Wild” and the “Safari Vet School” programs. Find Dr. Fowlds on Facebook at www.facebook.com/pg/DrWilliamFowlds/about\\n\\tWhat’s it like to guide a safari and/or observe wild animals in the African bush?\\nA guide since 1996, Schalk Pretorius has a passion and dedication for training and developing guides. He coordinates and guides the team at Ulovane Environmental Training (http://ulovane.co.za/aboutulovane/meet-the-team/), a school near the Amakhala Game Reserve to ensure that students are provided with the best education and personal development to become guides and providers of hospitality to those who visit Africa.\\n\\tIn addition, Schalk is certified in Special Knowledge and Skills (SKS) in Dangerous Animals & Birds and is a qualified Marine Guide and Tracker. Since 2001, he’s been an accredited Culture Arts Tourist, Hospitality Sports Sector Education and Training Authority assessor. Schalk is a great motivational speaker and has inspired, coached and assisted many people over the years.\\n\\tThe founder of AAEC, Linda Downing, believes one of the best ways to learn is person-to-person. Learning becomes extraordinary when persons like Pretorius and Fowlds bring their expertise and unique views from afar to our students in Arizona.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n.

Our alumni letter for December\\xa0is\\xa0Spencer Brickell. As a 2013 graduate from AAEC, Spencer Brickell continued her education at The University of Arizona. Having been highly active in FFA during high school, Spencer continued within the organization during a year of service as an Arizona Association State FFA Officer. Afterwards she continued working for Arizona FFA as a conference curriculum developer and facilitator. Spencer recently graduated from the U of A with a Bachelor of Science in Informal Education. She will be pursuing a Masters Degree in Adult and Higher Education from the University of Oklahoma beginning August 2016.\\nSpencer, Spencer, Spencer,\\nWhere to start? You’re moving to a brand new school, your hair is bright blue, and you feel as if you need to have your life plan all figured out. Well I hate to tell you but the blue will fade to a horrendous chlorine green and yes, it will look as awful as it sounds. Fortunately, the move to AAEC will go tremendously better than your hairdo and will help you with that life plan you’re consistently worrying about.\\nAAEC is large enough that you’ll have the opportunity to meet different people, but small enough for everyone to be a family. After the first month, the fears of not being accepted will diminish away. You’ll be taking classes at the local community college which will allow you to explore different career paths and prepare you for life at university (and trust me, in 3 years\\xa0when you’re at the University of Arizona, you will be filled with gratitude that you already know how to schedule courses). Not only will you find true friends, you will find your greatest mentors in the individuals who will not only teach you algebra and persuasive writing, but how to seize opportunities, grow from mistakes, and seek new heights.\\nI know this is slightly terrifying, but this move will give you the foundation you need to accomplish everything you desire to do. So Spencer, breathe slowly, walk through the door to AAEC, fight the nerves, and know that the green hair won’t be forever but the lessons from AAEC will.\\nSincerely,\\nSpencer Brickell\\nSONY DSC\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n.

The school’s blog now offers some “extra curriculum” news for faculty, students, parents and friends. Every now and then, we’ll feature news items regarding science, linguistics, history, math and other academic topics that arise in current events—this is what lifelong learning is all about!\\nMatch several varieties of scorpion, all in the act of stinging, with a high-speed camera and what do you get?  An interesting result! Leiurus quinquestriatus or the Deathstalker scorpion is capable of whipping its tail over its head at a rate of 51 inches per second.\\nAccording to information on this website (which also includes videos that capture the arc of the stinger and tail), \\nhttps://phys.org/news/2017-04-world-venomous-scorpion-action.html\\n “A comparison of half-a-dozen scorpion species shown in ultra-slow motion revealed an unsuspected variety of strike modes, they reported in the journal Functional Ecology.” Tail shape affects stinging motion, and the still unanswered questions relate to why the strike patterns are so varied.\\nThere are at least 50 species of scorpion that live in Arizona; 13 of them live in the mountainous regions of the state. A new species was discovered in 2013:  Vaejovis brysoni. It’s one thing to see a scorpion in the act of stinging in a laboratory and quite another to see one sting…in person. If you live in or near a scorpion habitat, strike back by shaking out your shoes, hats and other items of apparel before you wear them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n.

That’s why he inspired Dr. William Fowlds and Schalk Pretorius to come from South Africa to Arizona to meet with AAEC students over the past week.\\n            How did Dr. Rice meet Dr. Fowlds and Schalk Pretorius? Before retiring from his work at the Phoenix Zoo, Rice worked with the two men eight years ago to “create a hands-on safari,” one where it was possible to do more than just see the beauty of the exotic species of the African plains. “I wanted to touch the animals,” he said.  He’s been taking AAEC students on safari as a supplement to the education they receive at AAEC—in fact the one planned for this summer will be his sixth. Rice has been teaching at AAEC for seven years.\\n            In the course of visiting AAEC’s campuses this week, Dr. Fowlds reported that after his presentation on the endangerment of rhinos in South Africa and Asia, a young woman student thanked him…with tears of compassion for these animals. Dr. Rice said that the presentations Dr. Fowlds gave “were eye opening,” and explained that when he spoke of the crisis of poaching, “students were able to relate to that reality” in very personal ways.\\n            The message Dr. Fowlds left with students was that “losing 1,000 rhinos a year in South Africa due to illegal wildlife trade and the organized crime behind it” is what’s leading to the endangerment of so many species of wildlife there and in the world. His mission is to “raise awareness of how small the world is,” and that Americans should act to send a message to people in other countries, particularly those in Southeast Asia, that purchases of exotic species causes brutal, traumatic suffering to these animals and there is also a cost in human emotional impact. “These creatures’ lives are interlinked with ours. We can only do conservation of natural environments with these iconic species because they are what bring visitors, and it’s the visitors who pay for their conservation. This is a global responsibility.”\\n            In addition to their campus visits, Dr. Rice took Fowlds and Pretorius to see the Grand Canyon. Dr. Fowlds said, “Arizonans need to realize how beautiful their landscape is…we all must connect to our natural spaces so we do not lose them. We need these spaces to keep ourselves sane.”\\nDr. Dean Rice\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n.

The contest is open to “All high school and college students, as well as anyone looking to attend college or graduate school in the next year.” The rules of the contest may be found here: www. about.niche.com/scholarship-rules/no-essay-scholarship/\\nOne winner is selected by a random drawing every month, and you can apply once each month. The $2,000 may be used for tuition, housing, books or other education related expenses. Winners are announced in Niche’s e-newsletter and on the Scholarship Winners page.\\nLet us at AAEC know if you win!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n.

This month, meet a soon-to-graduate student from the Estrella Mountain campus. Instead of a letter-to-self, we interviewed Christopher Chung about the years he spent at AAEC.\\n Christopher Chung (who goes by Chris) may have walked before he learned to crawl. He says, “I flew planes before I drove cars.” \\n\\tAnd, thanks to AAEC, he also went to college before he ‘went to college.’ As he faces graduation, he’s appreciative that he has made inroads to his higher education. “Take advantage of the free college while you can, because college is expensive,” is the advice Chris gives to incoming students at any campus, during any year.\\n\\t Realizing that some teachers care very much about their students and help them succeed was one of the most profound experiences Chris had during his high school years. He says that his AAEC teachers played a role in pretty much everything he did, all the way through. “Ms. Wentworth and Mrs. Reyes have been there to help me with the college application process and with my personal goal of achieving an appointment to Service Academies of the United States Military.”\\n\\tDuring his three years as a student at AAEC, Chris was in the medical club and served as vice president for the National Honor Society. When he was not on campus, his time was spent in Boy Scouts, Civil Air Patrol, the Experimental Aircraft Association, Tuskegee Airmen, Inc., and he did some exploring with law enforcement officials engaged in solving crimes. Chris has been busy while at AAEC and advises students who have energy similar to his to “expect a lot of a work but it will be worth it because you will have a bigger payoff then most high school graduates.” \\n\\tSometimes, losses happen. Chris advises, “You will also make and lose friends but that’s OK. Stay focused on school but have an outlet outside of school where you can relieve stress. Don’t get too wrapped up in school; remember to live life while it’s happening and just have fun with this experience.” \\n\\tThere are many opportunities inside of AAEC where students may keep busy with learning—and enjoying life.

But here’s what happens when the DJ is a media artist and the LP is a disc made of wood:\\nhttp://www.cpr.org/classical/blog/turntable-plays-tree-rings-instead-vinyl-grooves-how-did-he-do\\nOne of the skills you should be learning in school is how to see old things in new ways. That’s what Bartholomaus Traubeck did when he saw the potential for music in the “year rings” of a tree trunk. Of course, if you matched up a needle and some speakers with rotating slice of circular wood, the needle would cut it’s own groove in the cellulose and not pick up any sound at all. Forget the needle. Traubeck used a camera to measure the spaces between the rings, their thickness and other textural considerations, then the data was analyzed and translated into notes to be played on a piano.\\nOf course, this involves the power of algorithm, scale…and imagination.\\nTraubeck found that different types of trees “play” different modalities of sound. Fir trees are fast growers; they have large gaps between their rings. The music they ‘produce’ sounds very spare and modern…in Traubeck’s chosen key of C minor. Trees with close-together rings, such as the Ash, play much more complex sounds.\\nUnlike the consistency you’d hear if you played Jethro Tull’s 1977 album titled “Songs From The Wood” over and over, each tree ring sings to the beat of its own drummer. That’s because each time he plays a tree, Traubeck has to decide where on the slab of wood to begin the ‘song.’\\nBe curious! What do you think the Blue Palo Verde or Ponderosa Pine might sound like?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis entry was posted in \\nUncategorized\\n.

Agribusiness & Equine Center Inc. have high expectations of themselves and of the students at the school.\\xa0 In an effort to provide the highest quality instructional program to the students at Arizona Agribusiness & Equine Center and to show how the school and family are working together to educate the children at Arizona Agribusiness & Equine Center Inc., the staff and parents/guardians of Arizona Agribusiness and Equine Center agree to implement the following programs and activities.\\n* AAEC will provide an academic program that is rigorous and challenging and provide and accelerated science and math program.\\n* AAEC staff will provide after school programs for all students.\\n* AAEC staff will communicate with families on an ongoing basis regarding the student\\'s academic progress.\\n* AAEC will implement a school program that emphasizes meaningful practice in all academic areas\\n* AAEC will involve parents/guardians in the governance of the school.\\nThe Home:\\nThe school and families of Arizona Agribusiness & Equine Center Inc. recognize that while both parties agree that the expectations listed here are necessary in order to strengthen the communication and commitment between the home and the school, rare occasions may arise where one or both parties will have difficulty fulfilling all or part of this compact.\\xa0 It is also recognized that the schools purpose is to support the community and its families in whatever manner is necessary and reasonable within its ability to do so, and likewise, it is the family\\'s responsibility to support the child and the school community.\\n* Parents/guardians at AAEC will send their children to school appropriately dressed, prepared to learn and on time.\\n* Parents/guardians at AAEC will encourage their students to read each night.\\n* Parents/guardians will attend at least one parent/teacher conference a year to discuss the academic progress of their children.\\n* Parents/guardians at AAEC will assist their children with their homework assignments on a regular basis to ensure completeness.\\nThe family-school compact from AAEC focuses on improving student\\'s academic achievement by setting high expectations for all students and for all of the school\\'s partners.\\xa0 The compact is only one piece of a larger family-school partnership focused on shared responsibility of the compact into a cohesive plan of action.\\xa0\\xa0 \\nParent’s Right-to-Know\\nProfessional Qualifications of Classroom Teachers\\nOn January 8th 2002, President Bush signed into law the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA).\\xa0 A provision of this new Title I law requires all districts to notify parents of all children that they have the right to request and receive timely information on the professional qualifications of their children’s classroom teachers.\\n*According to the new NCLB law (Section 111-State Plans (6) Parents’ Right-to-Know),\\xa0 LEAS must report:\\n(A)\\xa0 Qualifications-At the beginning of each school year, a local educational agency that receives funds under this part shall notify the parents of each student attending any school receiving funds under this part that the parents on request (and in a timely manner), information regarding the professional qualifications of the student’s classroom teachers, including at a minimum the following:\\n1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Whether the teacher has met State qualifications and licensing criteria for the grade levels and subject areas in which the teacher provides instruction.\\n2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Whether the teacher is teaching under emergency or other provisional status through which the state qualification or licensing criteria have been waived.\\n3.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The baccalaureate degree major of the teacher and any other graduate certification or degree held by the teacher, and the field of discipline of the certification or degree.\\n4.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Whether the child is provided services by paraprofessionals and, if so, their qualifications.\\n(B)\\xa0\\xa0 Additional Information – In addition to the information that parents may request under subparagraph (A), a school that receives funds under this part shall provide to each individual parent:\\n1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Information on the level of achievement of the parent’s child in each of the State academic assessments as required under this; and\\n2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Timely notice that the parent’s child has been assigned, or has been taught for four or more consecutive weeks by a teacher who is not highly qualified.\\nBecause the Arizona Agribusiness and Equine Center at South Mountain receives Title I Part A funds, all teachers must be highly qualified by the end of 2005-2006 whether or not they are paid with Title I funds (Sec. 1119 (a) (2). State Plan). This means that any teacher that is hired prior to the first day of the 2002-2003 school year has four years to obtain the necessary credentials.\\nNote:\\xa0 The notices and information provided to parents shall be in an understandable and uniform format and, to the extent possible must also be provided in a language that parents can understand.\\nNCLB-Notice of Assignment of Teachers During the Year\\nIn January 2002, the new federal law, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) was passed by Congress.\\xa0 The purpose of this letter is to inform you about a provision in this new law that requires all districts to notify parents regarding qualifications of their student’s classroom teacher.\\xa0 Every district that receives Title I funds must ensure that all teachers teaching in “core academic subjects” are highly qualified not later than the end of the 2005-2006 school year.\\xa0 This means that any teacher who was hired prior to the first day of the 2002-2003 school year has four years to obtain the necessary credential.\\nIn the event that your student has been assigned, or taught by a teacher who is in the process of completing the requirements for full certification, you will be notified by letter to your home when applicable that indicates the professional education of the teacher.\\xa0 If your student also is provided by services by\\xa0 a paraprofessional, the additional summary of his/her qualifications will also be attached.\\nAs we implement this new law, the district’s goal is to continue to keep parents informed about new requirements in a timely manner to enable us to work as partners in the education of our students.\\nRight to Receive Teacher Information\\nFederal law requires that we share with you the qualifications of teachers in Arizona Agribusiness & Equine Center.\\xa0 There are questions you may ask, including:\\nIs my child’s teacher licensed to teach the grades or subjects assigned?\\nHas the state waived any requirements for my child’s teacher?\\nWhat was the college major of my child’s teacher?\\nWhat degrees does my child’s teacher hold?\\nAre there instructional aides working with my child?\\xa0 If so, what are their qualifications?\\nThe Arizona Agribusiness & Equine Center inures that all teachers have at minimum a bachelor’s degree, and 67% have advanced degrees, 17% are currently working towards obtaining advanced degrees.\\xa0 If you would like to review the state qualifications\\xa0 and resumes of your student’s teachers you may do so by providing written notice to the school.\\xa0 If you would like more information about the school please feel free to contact the district office at 602-297-8500.\\nHomeless Students\\nHomeless students in the district will have access to the education and other services needed to ensure that an opportunity is available to meet the same academic achievement standards to which all students are held.\\nA liaison for students in homeless situations will be designated by the district at each site to carry out duties as\\nrequired by law.\\xa0 Please speak with the Principal at the site in which your child is attending in order to receive\\nfurther information.\\nThe district will ensure that homeless students are not stigmatized nor segregated on the basis of their status as homeless.\\xa0 A homeless student will be admitted to the district school in the attendance area in which the student\\nis actually living or to the student’s school of origin as requested by the parent and in accordance with the\\nstudent’s best interest.\\xa0 Transportation will be provided to and from the student’s school of origin at the request of\\nthe parent, or in the case of an unaccompanied student, the district’s liaison for homeless students.\\n Release of Student Information/FERPA\\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) (20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.\\nFERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children\\'s education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are \"eligible students.\"\\nParents or eligible students have the right to inspect and review the student\\'s education records maintained by the school. Schools are not required to provide copies of records unless, for reasons such as great distance, it is impossible for parents or eligible students to review the records. Schools may charge a fee for copies.\\nParents or eligible students have the right to request that a school correct records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. If the school decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student then has the right to a formal hearing. After the hearing, if the school still decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student has the right to place a statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested information.\\nGenerally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student\\'s education record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR § 99.31)\\n1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To personnel within the district who have legitimate educational interests;\\n2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To personnel of an education service district or state regional program where the student is enrolled or is receiving services;\\n3.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To personnel of another school, another district or institution of post-secondary education where the student seeks or intends to enroll;\\n4.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To personnel connected with an audit or evaluation of federal or state education programs or the enforcement of or compliance with federal or state legal requirements of the district;\\n5.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To personnel determining a financial aid request for the student;\\n6.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To personnel conducting studies for or on behalf of the district;\\n7.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To personnel in accrediting organizations fulfilling accrediting functions;\\n8.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena;\\n9.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 For health or safety emergency;\\n10.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 By request of a parent of a student who is not 18 years of age;\\n11.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 By request of a student who is 18 years of age or older or emancipated;\\n12.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Because information has been identified as “directory information.”\\nPersonally identifiable information will not be released without prior signed and dated consent of the parent, student 18 years or older or emancipated.\\nUnder FERPA, student information commonly referred to as “directory information,” includes such items as names, addresses, and telephone numbers and is information generally not considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed.\\xa0 AAEC must provide military recruiters access to secondary students’ names, addresses, and telephone listings.\\xa0 A parent or student 18 or older may opt-out of releasing this information by simply providing written documentation that this information is not to be released by the school.\\nPersonally identifiable information includes, but is not limited to:\\n1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Student’s name, if excluded from directory information, as requested by the student/parent in writing;\\n2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Name of the student’s parent(s) or other family member;\\n3.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Address of the student or student’s family, if excluded from directory information, as requested by the student/parent in writing;\\n4.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Personal identifier such as the student’s social security number;\\n5.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A list of personal characteristics that would make the student’s identity easily traceable;\\n6.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Other information that would make the student’s identity easily traceable.\\nNotice of and/or request for release of personally identifiable information shall specify the records to be disclosed, the purpose of disclosure and the identification of person(s) to whom the disclosure is to be made.\\xa0 Upon request of the parent or eligible student, the district will provide a copy of the disclosed record.\\nTransportation Policy\\nMonthly public city bus passes are available to all students currently enrolled within the Arizona Agribusiness & Equine Center.\\xa0 The parent or legal guardian can request a student be issued a pass for transportation purposes to attend the program.\\xa0 In addition, this form of transportation will be utilized to accommodate students if the school the child is attending, is receiving Title I funds and has requested to transfer because his/her school has been identified as needing improvement, corrective action or restructuring.\\xa0 Transfers of this type will be permitted only to schools that are deemed a safe school and that has not been identified as needs improvement, corrective action or restructuring.\\xa0 The obligation of the Arizona Agribusiness & Equine Center Inc. will terminate at the end of the school year if the school from which the student transferred is no longer in improvement status.\\xa0 Arizona Agribusiness is a Arizona State Charter school and does not identify any district boundaries.\\nThe family-school compact from AAEC focuses on improving student\\'s academic achievement by setting high expectations for all students\\' and for all of the school\\'s partners.\\xa0The compact is only one piece of a larger family-school partnership focused on shared responsibility of the compact into a cohesive plan of action.\\nUnder NCLB, schools must provide students\\' names, addresses, and telephone listings to military recruiters, when requested, unless a parent opts out of providing such information. A parent may opt out by notifying their school that they do not want his/her child\\'s directory information released.

The changes have taken effect on July 29th 2010. In \\norder to meet this requirement, Arizona Agribusiness & Equine Center \\nwill post all meeting notices electronically via the website on the \\ndistrict homepage at \\nwww.aaechighschools.com\\n.  A hard copy of the \\nagenda will be posted at the district office in the  lobby located at \\n3636 N. Central AVE. Phoenix Arizona 85012 at least 48 hours prior to the meeting. \\nThe Legislature made several changes to Arizona’s Open Meeting Law this year.  These changes impact all public bodies, including Charter Schools, and will take effect on July 29, 2010.  See HB 2209 (Laws 2010, 2nd Reg. Sess., ch. 88)\\nNotice Requirements for Charter Schools\\nCharter schools were previously required to file a statement with the Arizona Secretary of State indicating where the public notices of their meetings would be posted.  They no longer need to do so.  Instead, charter schools now must:\\n“conspicuously post” on their website a statement indicating the physical and electronic locations where all public notices of their meetings will be posted; and\\npost all public meeting notices on their website; and\\nprovide “additional public notice” of all meetings as is “reasonable and practicable.”\\nTechnical Problems\\nThe law also provides that if a public body’s website experiences a technological problem or failure that either prevents the posting of the required meeting notices or that temporarily or permanently prevents the use of all or part of the website, it may still hold the meeting without violating the Open Meeting Law, as long as it has complied with all of the other public notice requirements.  A.R.S. § 38-431.02(A)(1).\\nOpen Meeting Law Training Materials Requirements\\nThere are new requirements for the distribution and review of Open Meeting Law training materials.  Previously, such materials were distributed directly to new members before they took office.  Now these training materials, which are prepared and approved by the Arizona Attorney General’s Office, must be conspicuously posted on the Arizona Secretary of State’s website, and a newly-elected or newly-appointed member must review the materials at least one day before taking office.  A.R.S. § 38-431.01(G).\\nCharter schools should make certain that new members locate and review the training materials before they begin their public service.\\t\\nHighly-Qualified Educators Who Make a Difference • Rich Curriculum that Exceeds State Standards • FREE COLLEGE TUITION*\\r\\n*For Qualified Arizona Resident Students\\nPrograms\\nOur Schools\\nFor Parents\\nStudent Life\\nAbout AAEC\\nSouth Mountain\\nParadise Valley\\nRed Mountain\\nEstrella Mountain\\nPrescott Valley\\nResources\\nTax Credit Form\\nPre-Enroll\\nSitemap\\nCareers\\nArizona Agribusiness & Equine Center\\n District Office\\n 3636 N Central Ave Suite 1050\\n Phoenix, AZ 85012\\n ph. 602-297-8500\\n fx. 602-297-8540\\nGoverning Board Meeting Agenda\\n© Copyright 2013 by Arizona Agribusiness & Equine Center.
